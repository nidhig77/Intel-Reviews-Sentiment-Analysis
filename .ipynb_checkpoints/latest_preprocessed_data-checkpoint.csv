0,2023-11-20,5,79999,India,14900K,just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that i am able to achieve  it simply works buttery smooth  large applications open like notepad apps   it heats a lot though so i went with msi coreliquid liquid cooling solution   if looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical  however if setting up new pc then definitely go with it   my setup   msi mpg z790 carbon wifi intel i9 14900k msi rtx 4070ti msi mag coreliquid liquid cooler samsung 980 pro   1 tb ripjaws 32gb ddr5  bonus tip  if u are struck setting up ur pc then go to msi support and they are super responsive to assist you  i got my wiring fixed in matter of minutes ona video call by their assistant 
1,2024-03-28,1,79999,India,14900K,i don t liked the price of it   i also don t liked the performance of it   rather you can purchase i9 13th generation
2,2024-05-16,5,45000,Spain,14600KF,good processor that gives you to be able to play and perform office work  video rendering  etc 
3,2024-02-23,5,73700,Japan,14900KF,it s early to do anything as expected i am very satisfied 
4,2024-03-05,5,79999,Canada,14900K,good decision for my computer
5,2024-03-19,5,53000,Italy,14700KF,this processor is a real power that will meet the needs of gamers  professional users and those who seek maximum performance on their pc with a basic frequency of 3 6 ghz and a maximum boost frequency of 5 0 ghz allows you to effectively manage heavy workloads  making it ideal for activities such as video rendering  gaming and multimedia production for the most demanding gamers  the core ™ i7 14700kf offers extraordinary graphic performance thanks to compatibility with the most recent graphics cards and advanced technologies such as the intel® deep learning boost  which improves the performance of artificial intelligence in games and in thevirtual reality applications personally  i also do a lot of video editing and i have never encountered problems or slowdowns with davinci resolve or premiere altino price but unfortunately today the prices are these 
6,2023-11-08,4,53000,France,14700KF,good surprise on the power of this processor is a monster of power crucial point  it heats a lot i had to put an aio in 420mm to correctly cool the processor second point  it consumes a lot you always have the possibility of paying a maximum of 125 watts in your bios to deal with this  loss of 4 8   perf  honestly  if you are a gamer and you don t need raw power  turn to an i5  it will make the trick 
7,2024-01-07,5,53000,Japan,14700KF,fast shipping  works as advertised 
8,2023-11-03,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,so far so good  this cpu is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks  6ghz on two cores and 5 7ghz on all cores  unlimited tdp settings but thermally limited at 90c with  60mv offset  i have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900kf  especially when you consider the core to core deltas  i use my pc mostly for gaming and encoding  so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler  you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the uefi bios   in gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5 7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in cpu intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non cpu intensive games    update    i have the cpu now at 5 8ghz with ht disabled and a  75mv offset and it s working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding  it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5 8ghz   which is amazing since it s on an air cooled setup  though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling  as for temps  they are a little lower than running it at 5 7ghz with ht enabled and a  50mv offset  if i use a  75mv offset with 5 8ghz and ht enabled  my pc crashes  so disabling ht definitely enables the cpu to use less power   if you re predominantly using your machine for gaming  then i definitely recommend turning ht off regardless as most games tend to run better with ht disabled  but if you re using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming  then definitely turn ht on   the only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn t as good as i thought it would be  mine runs 48gb ddr5 7400 cl34 at 1 35v on the imc  but to hit ddr5 7600 cl36 with stability i need to increase the imc voltage to 1 41v which just isn t worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance  my previous 13900kf could do 48gb ddr5 7800 at 1 36v on the imc   core wise though  the cpu is definitely superior to 13th gen 
9,2024-05-20,5,79999,Japan,14900K,processing is fast 
10,2024-02-04,5,79999,Canada,14900K,used for 3d rendering  solid and fast  i am very happy with this cpu 
11,2024-01-22,5,79999,Germany,14900K,the intel i9 14900k is an impressive further development of the i9 12900kf the noticeable increase in performance that i have experienced is remarkable and shows the progress in technology the combination with the asus apex encore and the fast 7200 mhz ram delivers great results  after all  i was able to achieve 41 000 points in the cinebench r23 without overclocking the combination offers a solid basis for demanding tasks and gaming however  one should note that the exact performance can vary depending on the application overall  the i9 14900k seems to be a worthwhile investment  even if you were previously owned by the 12th generation 
12,2024-05-08,5,79999,the United States,14900K,before you purchase this cpu please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 aio as well  this cpu is in need of it  i m not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm  in my  asus  bios i turned on  disabled enforce all limits  so that the motherboard doesn t try to do on the fly oc to keep temps low and stability up  i haven t had any crashes or stability issues at all  i did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this  i kept my rtx 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable  i d say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my lian li galahad ii trinity 360  it s a monster of a cpu genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don t hesitate you won t regret it 
13,2024-03-13,4,45000,Japan,14600KF,although it is almost completely different from 13600k  it is criticized  but there is almost no difference in the price  so i think you can choose which one in terms of practicality  pal world is launched with the highest image quality setting  and the maximum number of base pals and ornamental cages are installed   imported from the ipad  imported with obs with multiple scenes  and at tiktok live studio delivery with 1080p60 8000kbps  commenting out  wan rice  voicebox  stick reading  chan   and android s emulator starts this condition  use ram20gb  vram9gb  depending on the composition of parts other than the cpu  i think that it can be said that it is a sufficiently used cpu postscript attached image is a score in which the pal world is actually launched with the highest image quality setting and various distribution tools are launched 
14,2024-04-12,4,53000,Japan,14700KF,to the next generation
15,2024-05-10,5,79999,Italy,14900K,top processor  truly amazing not cheap  but if you need performance this is the right processor 
16,2024-05-30,5,79999,Mexico,14900K,very good processor  but needs a good refrigeration 
17,2024-04-18,5,79999,Japan,14900K,the performance is wonderful  but the fever is still top class it is turned with authentic water  cooled  3 30cm radiator    but if it is still unlimited  the thermal slot ring will be pierced a little at the rating  it does not go at most 80 degrees  but in the case of unlimited  it will be stable by playing with the voltage vf curve a little currently  it is easy to handle at most 89 ° c however  considering the electricity bill  i think that it is not a good one in the cospa surface the speed is enough  such as the encoding  but the electricity bill for that amount i am satisfied with the performance in terms of performance 
18,2024-01-22,5,79999,Germany,14900K,the processor is quite expensive and we still favor intel instead of other manufacturers the installation of the processor was extremely easy and it delivers exactly the performance we hoped for there is now rest for the next few years 
19,2024-05-08,3,73700,Japan,14900KF,the game falls as reputation however  the problem is solved by setting the bios and graphics  but it is not for those who are at least for the first time if you still want it  let s study the settings well 
20,2024-03-19,5,79999,the United States,14900K,so i finally upgraded my home workstation  and went to this new i9 14900k  it is incredibly fast  i had a davinci resolve video project file that i rendered on my old setup  the i7 6850k and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render  on the new i9  the exact same file was re exported  took just over 8 minutes    almost a 3x speed increase   also  when you speed up footage in resolve  the old cpu could not play it back smoothly  it would jump and chug like crazy  the new i9  it plays it back sped up 800  no problems and i can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly  applications open u p much faster too  but that could be more due to the pcie4 0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme i had in the old build  the one thing i do not like about the new cpu  is the number of pci lanes  you only get 20  16 are pcie5 0 and 4 are pcie4 0  this wont be an issue for most people  but my old cpu had 40 lanes  allowing me to run 3 gpu s at the same time  and yes  i needed them  i use gpu rendering software that can use up to 8 gpu s in one system on one license and every additional gpu speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3d sims  with this new cpu  i can only run 2 gpu s and they run at 8x  cause they share the 16x  and that does leave me 4 full pcie4 0 lanes for the system drive  it is not a deal breaker  and the increased speed overall is well worth it  one thing everybody should be aware of  is these new intel chips have p cores and e cores  something my old cpu did not have  e cores can severely impact certain software performance  when i booted up the new machine and tried my ableton daw for the first time  i was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost  and the software was literally almost unusable   the e cores were slowing the software down so bad  i could barely change settings in the preferences   it was that bad  i had to install process lasso   fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it   and disable the use of e cores for ableton and then it worked very fast and is great  
21,2024-06-17,5,79999,Mexico,14900K,excellent processor and price  a unloocked comes so you can do overclocking  original packaging  and super fast delivery 
22,2024-02-03,3,53000,Japan,14700KF,it arrived in a paper bag although it is a fairly high precision equipment  the rough packing as usual is truly drawn i don t really recommend buying these precision equipment on amazon a big paper bag when you buy an mb paper bag when you buy a memory of course m 2 i bought it on amazon because of its simplicity  but i need to change my mind if you have to buy it on amazon  choose a manufacturer directly or buy it directly from the store the performance used is 14geni7  which is the only performance from 13gen  i use it with 4070ti  but both work and games are comfortable i heard that 14gen was the last i series and purchased it since the gpu is installed anyway  it is attached to f it is far from purchasing about 10 000 cheaper on sale and is cheaper than k since it has never been cheaper  we strongly recommend that you spend your budget on the gpu with a graphic function  it is helpful to be saved when the gpu is cool  but in my case  when the gpu was squeezed in the past  there were limited things with cpus alone  so as a result  pc until i purchase a new gpu i didn t use it taking advantage of that experience  i now purchased one gpu with a middle spec the drawback with f is that if there is no gpu  it will not even touch the screen  so if you make your own or try your own for the first time  you will not be able to confirm the operation unless you consider the order of purchasing let s put on i am satisfied with the product  but the shipping method is bad  so it is ⭐︎3 
23,2024-06-13,1,79999,Italy,14900K,unreliable seller  i made 3 rendered on this seller because the processors i ordered had defects but not only  also had a kind of square brand outside as if the brand had been reprinted  so intel contact and they tell me it is a lotstrange this and decide to make a replacement that i did not ask but that i thank anyway  and upon arrival of the processor replaced directly by intel i notice that this square mold is different practically does not exist  the sanding on the product was different    what can i say  they arealways retailers i do not recommend it 
24,2024-03-20,3,45000,Japan,14600KF,i tried to limit the power at 160w with a simple water cooling of the cooler master  but when i played a video with a cursor on youtube  the temperature rises suddenly  the temperature is stable for playing normally 
25,2024-05-03,1,79999,Canada,14900K,i have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal  i originally purchased the i9 13900k  did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that i stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card  i didn t refund as i assumed that i had done the damage  literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before i realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate  yet again assuming that i must have done something wrong i ordered this replacement chip  to find issues suddenly occuring again  this is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars   i m an it professional  have been in the industry for more than 20 years  and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer   i really hate to say it  i hold stocks in intel  i ve loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice  i can no longer say this   i honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it s predecessor  i had to purchase 2 rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before i could even lock down this issue   i hate to say it but if i d gone with a competitor i would have saved multiple thousands of dollars 
26,2024-04-09,5,79999,Mexico,14900K,of the best processors in the market excellent for any type of demanding task but it is important to combine it with a good liquid cooling or will have thermal neck i had to ask for it 2 times because the first one had a very common hardware error in these processors  a problem in shaders compilation that crrashea in some games or programs the second i asked came without any problem 
27,2024-01-23,3,79999,Japan,14900K,simply the performance and stability are satisfied if you look at a model with an i9  there is no difference in performance on the bench  so the same thing of the 13th generation may be better even if you do oc  you can not feel the difference in performance with 13 generations    
28,2023-10-29,1,79999,Canada,14900K,consumption up to 320 w too dear value for money
29,2024-04-04,5,79999,the United States,14900K,this professional cpu isn t designed for the average user  however  if you re a tinkerer at heart  eager to dive deeper than the surface level information often presented in youtube  videos   or should we say  commercials   this is unquestionably for you  i ve acquired multiple units for various builds configurations from a wide array of retailers—best buy  newegg  and others included   for those considering making a purchase  i highly recommend using an apex apex encore mobo or another reputable 2 dimm board  particularly for am5 or lga1700  if overclocking is your goal  a high quality cooler is crucial  for those opting for an aio  ensure it includes at least an 8th gen asetek pump and a 360 thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—  avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior lian li reversed sl infinity fans  genuine static pressure fans  capable of efficiently doing the job  are what you need  despite what your favorite youtuber might suggest  you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics   when selecting ddr5  opt for good binned options  if a high binned qvl compatible set isn t your choice  at a minimum  go for hynix a for single rank and hynix m for dual rank   the 14900k  when expertly tuned  becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in r23  with 6 2ghz boosting  5 9ghz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads  and 16 physical e cores at 4 7ghz for a total of 32 threads  of which only 8 are virtual  with hyper threading and e cores enabled  it supports 8200 to 8400 mts cl38 ddr5 ram  boasts sub 55ns bus latency  and sub 9 3ns fwl  it s a marvel in aida64 full  minus ssd  burn in stress test stability  adjusting all cores down to 5 8 and boosting to 6 0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns     did i mention overall cpu temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°c under heavy gaming loads  rarely exceeding 50°c  despite the capability of 3 eatx connections to easily deliver over 400w of power  i d advise against exceeding 325w daily  as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your cpu  for tinkerers  this cpu is a dream come true   as of this date—4 4 2024  we anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve  but that s a discussion for another time   the x3d elephant in the room  don t worry  i own one  and this is about science  not purchase bias     we ll sidestep intricate discussions about cldo  fclk  and mclk concerns  and why the substantial l3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet based imc in handling ddr5 for gamers  if the augmentation of the l3 cache wasn t primarily to address ddr5 issues stemming from the chiplet design  why not significantly enhance and accelerate the l1 cache  the design doesn t allow for it since it s not monolithic  which wouldn t be practical  those well versed in the subject matter understand this  while chiplets represent the future  we must acknowledge that this future hasn t fully materialized for every aspect of computing  allowing us to look beyond the  normie youtuber amd cults    indeed  i own a 7800x3d build and absolutely adore it  it excels in gaming    primarily in gaming  thus  there s no cause for concern  let s briefly touch on the  benefits  like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity  as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don t occur    humor me  over the planned 6 years   i  too  long for z390 features on my z790 board   end sarcasm   not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with ddr5 or pbo  or even under normal conditions  and texture stutter tearing    oops  and all those other delightful topics lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees  just having fun  do what you love   i don t blame amazon  intel  amd  or nvidia more than the other  manufacturing and shipping issues happen  the chip i received from amazon didn t meet my expectations  but my other purchases have been exceptional  by chance alone  the other four 14900ks i ve received from various distributors have been stellar   note  settings in pictures are daily driven    no stability concerns all aidia 64 stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming workload hours  i can get bus latency down to under 50ns but need to decrease core clock to locked 5 8ghz to stay at safe voltage     depends what needs done  either or is screaming fast even 55ns at that bandwidth 
30,2024-06-18,5,45000,Mexico,14600KF,very good 
31,2023-12-07,5,79999,the United States,14900K,a lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k  i say who cares  if you have a 13900k  don t upgrade  but if you have an older pc or 12th gen  this is a worthy upgrade  i absolutely love mine  it s a monster of a cpu   i honestly don t recommend air cooling it  it can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits  which most people don t know how to do  let alone even know what that means   if you re not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k  i recommend you do what i ve done to cool mine  you dont neeeed to  but it helps  i have an aio  all in one cooler  and i setup a push pull configuration on my radiator  that means i have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator  and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case  both are blowing upward  it creates more airflow  one side is pushing the air  the other side is helping pull that air through  then i got a thermalright contact frame  any lga 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap  it might say 12th 13th gen but it will also work on 14th gen  so get an aio  setup a push pull fan configuration and get a contact frame  it s helping my temps significantly  i typically stay in the high 50 s or low 60 s during 4k gaming  this cpu draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80⁰ occasionally  for a very brief moment   maybe 1 second or less 
32,2024-02-18,5,73700,Mexico,14900KF,i got in perfect condition  the processor had written exactly what i asked for  i9 14900kf he arrived fast and packed 
33,2024-01-11,4,73700,the United States,14900KF,i built 3 systems using 14900 series  they all had serious stability problems when in use  after researching for weeks and reinstalling os with no better result  i finally disabled overclocking  ai overclocking   which was running as high as 1 6v  i also found a bios setting after running some tools and set it intel fail safe  this allowed me to run the avx2 stress test successfully  it basically throttles the chip   i can t tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out  everything from chrome browsers to adobe cs would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all  tests  showed it was fine  i lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120  killed ai overclocking and set the intel setting and now have a very stable system  it outperforms my 5950x when encoding  which is impressive  it does run hot even with water cooling  if i had it to do over again  i would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a oodle issue as well when it comes to gaming with unreal 5  basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips   here s the thing  you will not notice a difference as nothing i use with the exception of handbrake  ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use  adobe cs uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync igpu simultaneously which rarely went above 40   and usually was around 15 20 when editing  hw encodes for hd were at 350fps  software  250  intel 300  so a small advantage in adobe cs is why i went with the 14900k vs kf   system was using  ai overclocking  pushing it to 6 2 roughly single core  disabled in bios now  specs  asus z290a wifi ii  corsair 96gb ddr5 5600  samsung 990 pro  cpu water cooled  3080ti  so the  k  is basically useless for me at this point and don t see myself doing it manually as it s just not worth it to me  that said  when stable  it s a very capable chip 
34,2024-02-11,5,79999,the United States,14900K,i m not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done  yes its very fast for only  550 its the king of the poor mans build pc  my last pc its replacing was a  1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70 77  faster than the 10980xe  the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 pcie lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot   i can t say the same about the 14900k heat  its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe  you can t just simply add a stock cooler or a  mc watercooler  and expect the problem will solve itself  this is the first cpu in my 26 yrs of building pc s you have to plan out your cooler set up   ever since a 2012 water leak from these mc watercoolers  all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands  ive never trusted them cost me  1500 in damages  the only water coolers that don t leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks  with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year   yes you can control temps with an air cooler  and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler  i ll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen   here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non oc not hitting above 99c on the p cores  1  noctua nh d15 chromax black   dual tower cpu cooler   140mm   black 2  noctua nf a15 hs pwm chromax black swap  this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you ll need it  3  fdxgyh 4 pcs cpu heatsink fan buckle pc mainboard cpu radiator fan 12cm wire buckle upper hook type fixing clip  these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans  4  easycargo 40mm heatsink kit 40mmx40mmx20mm  this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat  5  easycargo 100pcs heatsink assortment kit small cooler aluminum heat  these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you ll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps  6  thermal grizzly kryonaut  this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1 2c cooler than artic silver mx 6  7  thermalright intel 12th 13th generation lga1700 anti bending buckle   a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100  aluminum will al help dissipate heat   then i went to my mother board software options  mobo is an msi meg z790 ace max  select  cpu cooler tuning  select  tower air cooling  which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a water cooling reservoir you should also use this option  water cooling a 14900k and oc really does require a reservoir  and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you re simply using a pre built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the cpu is known for drawing 370w plus    so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78 100c on the p cores  and with the 300 watt limit the score was 2328 with temps 70 99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in   note this is from cpu testing that punishes the cpu realistically i don t see this cpu going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years   i personally do not recommend oc this cpu its already been pushed to its limits by intel at best for another 100 watts when all you re getting is 3 4 more fps and that s not worth it  and all these people bragging a 6 2 6 5ghz oc  there just flexing for clout  then they take the cpu back to default  i already have my p cores spiking to 6 002 at 288 300 watts  and under 99c temps  adding 0 198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming   personal note the msi meg z790 ace max gaming motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the  700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly compared to my last gen evga x299 dark had 12 phase   rip ega   
35,2024-05-22,5,79999,the United States,14900K,this is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors  if you put too much voltage you are going to damage it  i want to delid it but i don t see the need and here is why even if i can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter it will still need 3 5 to 4 2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds  i am running it   5 4 ghz all p cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable   and maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5 7 to 6 0 ghz i get the point that ppl want to have the bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit  i think that 5 4 5 3 5 2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded   and most games are gpu bound  i only use it in the gaming department for flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees  i had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4 5 ghz in a very small case  intel is a beast and this i 9 is very good   future proof for at least 5 years to come   note  i have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage   they are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them   i have been running this cpu 24  7 not an issue not a blue screen just underclock and undervolt and you are good to go this thing is a monster  
36,2024-06-04,5,79999,the United States,14900K,the intel core i9 14900k processor is a beast when it comes to gaming and multitasking  with its 24 core configuration  8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores   this cpu handles everything from intense gaming sessions to heavy duty content creation smoothly and without a hitch  the unlocked feature allows for overclocking  providing additional performance boosts as needed  integrated graphics are a great addition  capable of handling basic video tasks and supporting displays without the need for a separate gpu  this processor consistently delivers high speeds and reliable performance  making it a top choice for anyone building a high end pc  whether you re gaming at the highest settings  streaming  or juggling multiple intensive applications  the i9 14900k stands up to the challenge 
37,2024-06-09,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,in 2020 i made the mistake of switching to amd  the system i built was so annoying  the fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load  and it literally made the processor wait for the fan  at least that s how it seemed  slowed everything down and made a lot of unnecessary noise  with my new intel based system  those issues are gone  and i have a lightning fast pc  learned my lesson about amd 
38,2024-06-20,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,works great in new build  only slight issue is i felt like there wasn t quite enough thermal paste    i had some leftover from a previous build so i added some additional just to be safe 
39,2024-06-17,5,79999,the United States,14900K,awesome cpu  and an absolute beast   i did not  however  recieve my code for star wars outlaws  amazon says it s an intel thing  yet you cannot contact intel to ask  any ideas 
40,2024-06-13,5,79999,the United States,14900K,the cpu is really strong for both gaming and video editing movie creation  haven t had any issues within the past 6 months i ve had this  never gave any issues  no malfunctions and it never stutters and this is without o c  the cpu 
41,2024-05-06,5,79999,the United States,14900K,this processor has way better memory controller then my previews 12900k for my ddr4 clocking at 3950 mhz at 15 15 15 30 timing error free  i had heard about the 14900k has crashing issues so far i have no issues with unreal engine 5 games  tekken 8  battlefield 2042  etc  etc     my cpu is running 59 ghz all p cores   1 35v limited power p1 and p2   253 watts  therefore  won t over heat and degrade the silicon of my 14900k  55° average temperature on gaming with a good cooler msi meg core liquid s360   aio at full speed push and pull fans  all my games runs extremely smooth at high frame rates with no stuttering 
42,2024-06-14,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,i was afraid to purchase the 14th gen after all the talk of stability issues  when the the bios fixes were mentioned i took a shot  i m up and running with the power limits adjusted accordingly 
43,2024-05-08,5,79999,the United States,14900K,it s a processor  it s like any other processor that processes  only better   it destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in corel painter  it has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it   runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games  but the water cooler is up to the task  still  it reveals what games are just piles of trash code   just remember to update your bios because it s still a relatively new processor  and stay away from windows 11 
44,2024-05-30,5,53000,the United States,14700KF,my husband built me a computer from scratch because my old one was to slow for him  the i7 was the last thing i needed  it was easy for him to install  it performs fantastic 
45,2024-06-13,5,53000,the United States,14700KF,terrific performer for my needs  runs fast and pretty cool

48,2024-05-19,5,79999,the United States,14900K,i upgraded from an i9   11900k  pretty good performance increase on benchmarks  i haven t gamed on it yet  still in the process of locking down cables and loose hardware   mb gigabyte z790 aorus pro x
49,2024-06-06,5,79999,the United States,14900K,able to compile rust code way faster now 
50,2024-04-05,3,79999,the United States,14900K,once they came down in price  i did get a i9 14900k as an  upgrade  from a i9 13900kf to i9 14900k   it s ok but i can t rave over it  it is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade   the i9 14900k is fast but not more so that a i9 13900k  for me  the cinebench r23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen  though the i9 14900k appears to run ddr5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9 13900k  also  the i9 14900k is enabled for xtu ai enable tuning in xtu but it s not that helpful  i even wonder if it is worth getting a k at all  these cpu s are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking   i did not notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures  maybe a slight improvement but i did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so i am doubtful that the running temps are better  also  i suggest that you not let these chips get anywhere near tjmax  100c   i had one i9 13900kf literally fail due to allowing it to get to tjmax frequently when stress testing  a second one became slightly flaky   i thought the built in arc display support of the k version might be helpful since i intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built in arc on a side display  but as it turns out  it wasn t worth it for me  if you are gaming with this level of processor  you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays  imo  you are better off getting a kf and spending the money so saved on better graphics card   the original asking price was insane  i bought it on a whim on a late night  on the morning morning after  i had buyers remorse  tried to cancel but could not  so instead  i refused the package  it took literally 6 months to get a refund  that was rather irksome 
51,2024-05-25,5,79999,the United States,14900K,ooohhhhh boy this is fast and secksy  maybe the women will love me long time for buying mmmmmm boy im insecure
52,2024-04-05,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor  the irony is i have a asus pro art mb 750 model that does the integration of components  my station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with pc mark 10 and cinebench  3d mark declares the obvious that i need to upgrade my video card from several years ago  the ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly  lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000 s on my core 2quad  enjoying my thermal right air cooler it does a great job for half the cost of my older noctua cooler on my prior haswell i7 
53,2024-06-02,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,amazing and received so quick   3
54,2024-05-05,4,45000,the United States,14600KF,the processor is great and arrived sealed in good condition  however  the cardboard box had no protection and it could easily be damaged if it fell 
55,2024-05-10,5,79999,the United States,14900K,this cpu is a absolute monster  period  i love it   i have it paired with a 4080 super  any new game i can usually pull 300 fps on any game 
56,2024-05-11,5,79999,the United States,14900K,i had some issues after install with windows wanting me to buy it over again  while i was on with microsoft tech support even they were like   that s a heck of a setup    
57,2024-04-18,5,79999,the United States,14900K,i previously purchased the 13th gen version of this processor and it had a defect  intel was very good at getting a refund sent via rma  although it took awhile  i purchased this version instead and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my issues resolved  the cpu can handle almost everything thrown at it  certainly a good purchase and better than the 13th gens that seem to have more issues 
58,2024-03-29,5,79999,the United States,14900K,words truly cannot express how powerful  but also how hot this cpu is  after upgrading from a ryzen 3700x to this  my work speed  gaming  everything cannot lay a finger on this thing  the only time s i ve seen this truly cap out is during extreme compression  decompression  and specific rendering situations  the only con which isn t truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly hot  if you re going to get this  i would absolutely suggest a 360 aio cooler or you re going to experience thermal throttling  or even thermal shutdowns  that was my original issue  but quickly upgraded coolers  and this thing is a monster 
59,2024-04-02,4,45000,the United States,14600KF,i m definitely gonna upgrade later but this is handling itself pretty well with dragon dogma 2 to fortnite and everything in between  only gripe is that there s no small arrow on the actual cpu to indicate where to place it on motherboard so if you tossed the packaging without looking you might be bit confused with orientation otherwise good 
60,2024-02-24,4,53000,the United States,14700KF,wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time  all the description says is that  discrete graphics is required   it would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the f version stands for no integrated graphics card  if you re doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing  most software will take advantage of the processor having an igpu as well and so i m actually losing performance with this model version  i ll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an f  i would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the f version 
61,2024-04-24,5,53000,the United States,14700KF,i have used this for my build and 3 others  didn t realize what the f is for   get the k  it s not much more and worth the extra  that being said  this beast will do everything you want it to do and more 
62,2024-05-19,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,i like it
63,2024-04-15,5,53000,the United States,14700KF,no more lining up pins  now you just make sure this thing sits in the way it belongs and off you go  i ve had an h170i on it the whole time but it barely gets into the 40 s when under extreme load  for the price  the 14700kf is the way to go imho
64,2024-03-25,5,53000,the United States,14700KF,i paired this with a  gigabyte z790 eagle ax lga 1700 intel z790 atx motherboard with ddr5  m 2  pcie 5 0  usb 3 2 gen2x2 type c  intel wi fi 6e  2 5gbe lan  q flash plus  ez latch  mobo and tgdgamer  t 240mm black argb liquid cpu water cooling with 240mm argb pwm fan  temperature display  computer water cooling   the intel application used ai to tweak my cpu to squeeze out more performance  but under 100  load it will often thermally throttle and sporadically hit 100c  i am considering finding a better cooler to keep up with this racehorse 
65,2024-05-01,5,79999,the United States,14900K,due to the purchase of the processor  they said that they gave a game i do not see any intel resting code is intel the best in the market
66,2024-04-29,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,didn t get to use this because the motherboard i ordered with it was d o a  not the seller s fault  of course  i ended up refunding 
67,2024-04-29,5,79999,the United States,14900K,must have 360mm water cooler for this cpu it runs very hot fast  my 260mm wasn’t enough to cool it down at all while gaming 
68,2024-04-13,5,79999,the United States,14900K,it s the current intel flagship desktop cpu   we had to upgrade from 120mm to 240mm liquid coolers for it   important note  you may need to manually set the max power and max amps in the bios  there s currently an issue that causes them to be set to insanely high values  4096w  by default causing the chip to become unstable under heavy loads 
69,2024-05-12,5,53000,the United States,14700KF,it doesn t heat much but i use a 360 corsair radiator
70,2024-02-17,4,79999,the United States,14900K,as a gamer data scientist programmer tinker i wanted a mainstream cpu built by a well established company  with intel s i9 14900k cpu i have a top of the line general purpose chip which provides above average performance in all the computational fields i have an interest in  i only gave it a 4 star rating because i had hoped that intel would have brought the 15th generation chips out in 2023 q4 as they said rather than just the mobile chips 
71,2023-10-22,5,79999,the United States,14900K,sorta came from a 13900k but i gave that to a relative after their x299 i9 7940x system began to have issues  he bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked skylake x processor  he fixed the issue with the x299 system  but he decided to stay with raptor lake  all of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom  and i could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable  i was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version  but i decided to wait for the 14900k   the 14900k i got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom  i already set all p cores to 5 8ghz  while keeping the double core turbo boost at 6 0ghz  i also set the cache to 5 2ghz and it s completely stable  i was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k  just happy my 14900k isn t a lottery loser   while the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same  the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller  if you re looking to do a ton of ram overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go     but that s not to say if you d get a 14900k with a good memory controller  both my 13900k and 14900k work with ddr5 7200 ram with xmp set  and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages   if you re buying the 14900k off the get go and building a new system around it  then i recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the bios flashback feature 
72,2024-03-13,4,79999,the United States,14900K,excellent super fast processor i recommend all those who want to update their computer or put together a new i use it with the 4080 super excellent combination video card   
73,2024-03-15,5,79999,the United States,14900K,this is the first time i ve ever went for it and got an i9  i usually stick to the i7  i am so glad i decided to take the chance because this thing screams  to think that i can also squeeze out more by overclocking is just insane  every application i ve ran is so snappy and responsive  being an impatient human  this thing makes me happier every time i turn it on  power and speed are right where i like it  this chip is just so damn sweet 
74,2024-04-28,5,53000,the United States,14700KF,new  great product  came as described and very fast at the same day 
75,2023-10-20,4,79999,the United States,14900K,i built pc with the new intel i9 14900k  and i must say  it s a beast of a processor  coming from an i7 8700k  the performance boost is nothing short of incredible  multitasking  gaming  and content creation have all seen a significant improvement  multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother  it s a productivity powerhouse  the clock speeds are no slouch either  making it excellent for single threaded tasks and gaming  the major downside of this cpu is the heat it generates  even with a high end cooling solution  it tends to run hot  and that s something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution  be ready for this cpu to draw a significant amount of power at full load  it can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you re not already prepared  the intel i9 14900k is an incredible processor  and the upgrade from an i7 8700k is substantial  its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag  if you re willing to address these challenges  you ll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience 
76,2024-04-29,5,53000,the United States,14700KF,i love it 
77,2024-03-28,5,79999,the United States,14900K,my benchmark is almost at 14k now with without overclocking   nvidia gtx 1080  65gb 6400 ram and 2gb pcie5 ssd  gigabyte z790 elite x wifi7 motherboard  i won t need to change this setup for the next decade or so like i did with my last pc   worth the money  but you ll need the right ssd to go with it 
78,2024-03-28,5,79999,the United States,14900K,even you re getting hotter temps despite having great cooling  it s normal for this cpu  it s a beast  i recommend using a triple fan radiator aio cooler to keep this bad boy as cool as possible  and make sure to blow the hot air out of your pc case 
79,2024-02-24,5,79999,the United States,14900K,not sure what more to say other than it s crazy powerful  make sure you have a high watt power supply to go with this and all the devices you plan to run with this  and really don t go small on the cpu cooler  this thing is good at figuring out when to throttle down  you ll get it s best performance with a large aio water cooler  if you can build your own water cooling system  better   also  make sure your mobo manufacturer have all the drivers available to work smoothly with these lines of processors 
80,2024-02-20,4,79999,the United States,14900K,it arrived in a sealed package but it was stained and with a thumbprint on it  looks like it might have had thermal paste removed  i m not crazy about that because i paid for new  but it seems to work fine 
81,2024-03-22,5,79999,the United States,14900K,this is an excellent  stable cpu  care must be taken to keep it cool  it is a hot running cpu  to avoid heat throttling at 100deg celsius in heavy duty gaming or testing  order a high end liquid cooler  for professional work and easy gaming a big block fan cooler will be just fine as it is much more quiet  to save a little money  if at all  the i9 13900k will work just as well performance wise 
82,2024-04-20,5,79999,the United States,14900K,works   what else is needed  a little expensive 
83,2024-02-03,4,45000,the United States,14600KF,great cpu  not as powerful as i thought it would be  ended up going with a 14700k  just seemed a bit laggy even when running at 5 8 all core   great cpu though and runs cool
84,2024-01-18,4,73700,the United States,14900KF,may be a little excessive and unnecessary  but glad i got one when i did  sometimes these things get hard to acquire  especially at a decent price   seems to run a little hotter than my ryzen 9 7950x  so i went with dual 420mm  if you buy this cpu you should really consider custom loops or large cases with 420mm aio support 
85,2024-06-07,3,53000,the United States,14700KF,i just got mad oved the tumbling issue  the performance of the processor is fine 
86,2023-10-20,5,79999,the United States,14900K,it s a raptor lake refresh cpu  if you have a 13900k you don t need this  unless you are an extreme over clocker or need every possible mhz per thread and stability  if you have a 13900ks you really don t need this cpu   if you have a 12th gen  it might be worth it to you if you need that extra performance but really depends on what you do   if you are on 11th gen or below and were looking to upgrade  you might as well get a 14700k or 14900k or kf as they are similarly priced with the 13th gen processors   also  the 14700k has a 4 more e cores and higher clock speeds which can result in 10 20  performance gains depending on the workload compared to the 13700k   otherwise wait for the next generation of cpus to make the leap 
87,2024-03-24,5,79999,the United States,14900K,the intel i9 14900k delivers impressive performance with its high clock speeds and advanced architecture  it excels in demanding tasks like gaming  content creation  and multitasking  offering smooth and responsive performance  the integrated graphics are decent for light gaming and multimedia tasks  however  it s power hungry and may require robust cooling solutions  overall  it s a top choice for enthusiasts and power users seeking uncompromising performance 
88,2024-05-04,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,play video this beauty does exactly what it says  super fast overclocking her to 6 ghz run smooth 
89,2023-10-24,5,79999,the United States,14900K,intel has always worked better for me than competition  i feel like reviewers benchmarks may not be realistic to a typical pc setup  i m getting 620fps at 1440p in rainbow six siege on a 4090 rog strix oc  yes at this framerate my fans do spin fast and are loud  but i limit the frames to 143 and then it is quiet and the fans hardly spin   case  corsair 4000d gpu   asus rog strix 4090 oc cpu   intel core i9 14900k psu   msi mpg a1000g pcie 5 atx 3 0 cooler   arctic liquid freezer ii 280 fans   4x antec pf12 series storage   2x samsung 990 pro ssd 4tb 870 evo 4tb 2 5 inch memory   64gb 2x32 corsair vengeance 5600mhz cl40 xmp  note  i would not recommend the cooler for this case and mb combo heatsink on mb blocks cooler which doesn t properly screw in totally 
90,2024-03-25,5,24000,India,11400F,i bought this i5 11400f in 2023 and still it does its job with no sweat  well my purpose is editing in premier pro and gaming  1080p resolution  paired with rtx 3060  its a beast at 1080p  played competitive games and high graphics intense games like forza horizon 5 etc etc    does its job fine  a common statement is intel processor s heat better than amd processors  well it is true  it heats very well  stock cooler not enough  my pc even shut downed 3 times when playing high end games used with stock cooler  a decent air cooler is enough to calm down this one  it is not unlocked in fact  so no explanation needed i guess  if u are gonna build a new pc build in 2024 or onwards   please consider 12th gen atleast because u can have great future upgradability chance  when said all these  i took this over 12400f because i felt this enough for my needs and it didn t disappointed me  when considering it is just an i5 i got flabbergasted by its performance fr  many people say 11th gen is bad but i felt it as worthy for the money i spent and im not gonna do upgrades in future so    yeah overall it is a good product and im happy with it👍  once again  don t even consider any of 11th gen processors if u are gonna pc build in 2024 and future because 13th gen and 12 th gen is way more future proof that this 11th gen  so yeah that s it 
91,2023-11-01,5,24000,India,11400F,good
92,2022-06-30,4,24000,India,11400F,good processor  have a background check about who is selling you this 
93,2023-07-29,5,24000,India,11400F,compatible with intel 500 series   select intel 400 series chipset based motherboards intel optane memory support thermal solution included pcie gen 4 0 support
94,2023-05-06,5,24000,India,11400F,i am very happy   like temperature   like performance   and never heat  
95,2022-11-19,5,24000,India,11400F,play video this processor in window 11 smoothly run normal gaming   regular use best processor
96,2023-01-17,3,24000,India,11400F,worst packaging i have seen  a 100 ₹ item is better packed then this one  fortunately it survived 
97,2022-09-16,3,24000,India,11400F,there is a lot of money than the market rate  i7 comes for so much money  11 generations come from the market 
98,2022-01-21,5,24000,India,11400F,value for money
99,2022-12-27,1,24000,India,11400F,poor product
100,2023-04-09,4,24000,India,11400F,yes  it is intel i5 11400f 2 65 base clock  processor comes with 6 core and 12 threads  boost clock speed is 4 40ghz  8mb smart cache memory technology 
101,2022-01-03,5,24000,India,11400F,intel i5 11400f 11th generation processor  f  without integrated graphics  price on 01 01 2022 ₹15948   mother board socket lga1200  required 3200 mhz ddr4 ram
102,2023-11-23,5,24000,the United States,11400F,omg    this is the first intel cpu i have bought and tried in almost 10 years  for having 6 cores it surprised me how well it performs on fps games  does better than many 8 core cpus   this i5 11400f seems very snappy with decent frame rates at 1080p and 1440  maybe a perfect match for an nvidia 3060 gpu or radeon 6700 gpu or maybe an intel arc a750 gpu  this cpu is not top teir cutting edge but if you are building an entry level 1080p gaming pc like i was or maybe a mid tier 1440p gaming setup and limited on funds this cpu could be a nice option 
103,2023-06-27,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,it works very well any type of task from video editing and images to playing any type of video game also for the price i recommend it a lot    🤙✨
104,2024-03-03,5,24000,Germany,11400F,very good price performance ratio
105,2023-04-21,5,24000,Japan,11400F,the performance is stable
106,2023-06-21,5,24000,Singapore,11400F,wanted to upgrade my old 6 year old build  salvaged most parts and put in this core i5 11400f processor  reasonably priced at   200  everything works booted fine  no issues   you will need your own graphics card  salvaged mine  for better resolution and a fan cooler  again salvaged   intel coolers are not the best  all in all a good processor for office work  not for gaming   get an core i7 for that  
107,2024-04-18,4,24000,Canada,11400F,works as it should 
108,2023-12-26,4,24000,Canada,11400F,good buy
109,2023-07-13,5,24000,Germany,11400F,very good cpu for a work pc but also its very good gaming cpu no question
110,2023-08-02,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,he arrived the next day and works as expected at a good price it is version f  so it does not support integrated graphics  it is normal   an external card is required to deliver video 
111,2022-02-25,5,24000,Singapore,11400F,noticed that the price of 11400 f  has dropped quite significantly since the launch of alder lake  for the price of quality b560m motherboard and the cpu  it is a value choice 
112,2022-12-07,5,24000,Japan,11400F,unless you frequently ask for cpu replacement or kodawari since this cpu  which has become cheaper due to the delay  and the asus gaming motherboard that happened to be less than 10 000  it was a little cheaper than the 12th generation of corei3 and the low  priced motherboard i am satisfied with the performance 
113,2024-06-03,5,24000,the United States,11400F,easy install and works great  much faster than a previous tenth generation i3 
114,2023-05-05,3,24000,Canada,11400F,doesn’t perform as well as i would expect for  200 plus the stock cooler is completely useless i would strongly advise an aio because with the stock cooler on moderate usage the cpu was way over temp
115,2024-01-24,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,i exceed my expectations  the difference with an i3 processor is noticeable  with a 2060ti video card the graphics are very good
116,2023-11-17,4,24000,Japan,11400F,・ the product was properly packed ・ cpu and cpu cooler were included  so it was possible to attach it properly ・ the temperature of the cpu  but if it did not load high  it was about 40 ° c it s surprisingly normal because we haven t even played heavy games at the moment 
117,2024-03-02,5,24000,the United States,11400F,had to upgrade my old gaming computer  works great with a 2060  shipping arrived earlier than expected
118,2022-02-07,5,24000,Japan,11400F,it is a good cospa cpu thanks to the gpu omission compared to the first generation i7 920  which i used for a long time  it was not so fast the gpu is a middle high  range that had been replaced about 5 years ago  the case and power supply were diverted  and it was quite cheap and reborn as the current middle range pc  and the satisfaction is high 
119,2023-07-11,4,24000,the United States,11400F,the cpu is great for gaming  i use it only for that but the stock coolers is really bad  when first installed got temps about 90 95 celsius while gaming and had to check online for help  it turned out to be a bios setting  dont remember the exact name of the option  but i understand most gaming high end motherboards come with it eneabled  that makes it always go boosted clocks and therefore hot temps  disabled it and got temps down to 70 75 while gaming wich is still hot for my likes but i guess it s acceptable for the stock cooler   soon getting it a liquid cooler  but mostly for aesthetics  a decent air cooler will do the job
120,2023-07-22,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,everything arrived well and on time
121,2023-02-05,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,an excellent and more than enough processor for mid  range video cards and even some high  end with the processor i have an rx 6650 xt and it is excellent and even left over in any game or program i am a video editor and i have several windows open at the same time and several processes running in the background and i have never had problems the only bad thing is the stock fan  it serves the basics  but it feels of poor quality 
122,2024-05-15,5,24000,the United States,11400F,initially i thought it was gonna be a bad product and its gonna be broken due to the distance it has to go  but it has worked exceptionally well
123,2024-06-04,5,24000,the United States,11400F,it yields very well for games and basic tasks  with a good graphics card and cooling  it is enough 
124,2021-12-30,5,24000,Japan,11400F,it is used in water  cooled and is very stable it can be driven around 4 2ghz and the cospa is the best i would like to consider the heat problem after overcoming the harsh environment in the summer 
125,2023-01-28,4,24000,Mexico,11400F,i consider that it is the best processor for this price  and even more if you have a good graph  although this processor does not make a bottleneck with high  end graphics
126,2022-10-17,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,although this processor is last year  it is still in the sweet point for gaming  i5 exceed the i3  but from i5 to i7 it is almost the same  i repeat  this is in gaming  because for productive tasks there is more difference anyway  with this processor  4k photo and video editing can be made without problems i chose this over generation 12 because an i5 12400f would have barely given a 10 15  better performance  but the price of the processor and motherboard were for much cheaper
127,2023-07-21,5,24000,the United States,11400F,for the price  this is a great cpu  be aware that this chip does not have built in graphics  so you ll need one   this worked perfect for my budget build i did with my son for his first gaming pc  you can t overclock it  but it does max out at 4 4 ghz and the 6 cores makes it work faster than i expected  paired with a decent gpu and this chip is more than enough for a decent system 
128,2022-09-26,3,24000,Japan,11400F,i was satisfied with the function  but the box was too tattered 
129,2023-09-03,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,super recommended to assemble your middle range pc
130,2024-04-05,5,24000,the United States,11400F,very good
131,2024-04-30,4,24000,the United States,11400F,works great but the pre applied thermal paste it came with was dry
132,2024-03-05,4,24000,the United States,11400F,i paired my core i5 11400f with a rx 6600 it a perfect combo for 1080p gaming i just upgraded to it works grate 
133,2024-03-07,5,24000,the United States,11400F,great
134,2023-12-01,5,24000,the United States,11400F,literally  like new  he came in his box and with his stock dissipator 
135,2023-10-26,5,24000,the United States,11400F,built a gaming pc for my grand daughter  wanted something powerful  yet affordable this fit the bill  works great and is typical intel quality 
136,2023-12-12,5,24000,the United States,11400F,very good
137,2023-08-22,5,24000,the United States,11400F,i bought this based on performance to price for my second pc  i was going to use a 10000 series cpu but discovered that using the 11400 utiilizes the features on my motherboard better  this one works very well with my motherboard 
138,2022-05-13,5,24000,the United States,11400F,i have been using my 11400f for a few months now and i couldn t be happier with it  it s not a top of the line processor when compared to others of the same generation or the competition but for  150 intel came in clutch with a great value for money to all budget gamers   i haven t yet found a game where this processor struggles or bottlenecks my graphics card and for daily usage keeping things opened in the background it is literally a king  if you are upgrading from an older generation intel it will blow your mind how much faster processors have gotten over the years   all in all  i am happy with my purchase and will have this bad boy last me for a while 
139,2023-02-27,4,24000,the United States,11400F,the processor is excellent but you will need to buy a more power discipler if or yes  with the smallest that you force the pc it will reach temperatures of  85 ° which will make the pc turn off to avoid damage  when you buy a decent discipleryou can play and use it without any problem
140,2023-07-25,5,24000,the United States,11400F,i had my doubts  i saw reviews  technical specifications  game tests and performance  but things are different when you have it in your hand  i assembled my computer with this processor and i can say that it was a good choice 
141,2023-06-18,4,24000,the United States,11400F,does the job  not as great as other options  but works
142,2023-11-10,5,24000,the United States,11400F,100 
143,2023-05-20,4,24000,the United States,11400F,i did not like the fact that brings or its original box and less a cooler
144,2023-07-15,5,24000,the United States,11400F,this cpu is 11th generation intel 1200 lga  it is very fast  i upgraded from an lga 1155  so i am very happy with my purchase  no issues regarding this cpu 
145,2023-08-23,5,24000,the United States,11400F,although i have to buy another dissipator is it worth it
146,2023-08-03,5,24000,the United States,11400F,enough compute power to run games   basic tasks without bottlenecks  great entry level cpu 
147,2023-03-08,4,24000,the United States,11400F,it works excellent with heavy editing tasks and games  more than recommended
148,2024-05-08,2,24000,Mexico,11400F,for people who want to build a pc gamer the term of processors with lyrics f at the end they necessarily need a graphics card to give video
149,2023-07-09,5,24000,the United States,11400F,can run all the game with out lagging and reach 240 fps
150,2023-04-27,5,24000,the United States,11400F,don’t let marketers fool you  you don’t need more than 6 cores for gaming  if you want more  cool  but don’t listen to those who act like it’s needed 
151,2022-11-06,5,24000,the United States,11400F,i love this lil cpu  the only thing that suck aparently theres a promo for a free copy of call of duty mw2 2022 release but amazon order does not qualify   what am i supposed to go to best buy and by my cpu there in order to get the intel game promo         
152,2022-11-09,5,24000,the United States,11400F,got this as a amazon prime deal for the wife as an upgrade  great performance per dollar  great benchmark scores  she plays her games much smoother now  love intel cpus for their hassle free experience  paired with an asus tuf b560 motherboard  16gb ddr4 3200mt s c14  and rx 570 4gb  great midrange build 
153,2023-05-06,5,24000,the United States,11400F,easy to install and yeah  for my first pc build it works perfectly fine  gaming is smooth with it 
154,2022-03-28,5,24000,the United States,11400F,i wanted to update my computer system to the new win 11 platform  all other components were already updated  except my tpm chip was ver  1 0 switch had to be replaced  the big problem was the cpu  after taking a chance and selecting one from the cpu requirement list  i chose the i5  wow  now i don t have a fast system  i have a supper fast system  i love it 
155,2022-07-25,4,24000,the United States,11400F,for the price  you can’t beat that  i was getting a bit of bottlenecking with my 6th gen i5 6600k  so this cpu definitely out classes that  not a crazy cpu but is worth it for the money 
156,2023-06-17,5,24000,the United States,11400F,works well with rx 6600 xt 
157,2023-04-19,5,24000,the United States,11400F,it works with total normality  very good performance  a little scrape the fan  nothing serious everything well 
158,2022-09-02,5,24000,the United States,11400F,maybe the intel i3 cpus will be a thing of the past but going from a i5 4570 to this i5 11400f has been nice  paired with a solid z590 board  32gb of ddr4 ram  and a gtx 1070ti i m certainly happy  six core cpus are here to stay 
159,2023-05-14,5,24000,the United States,11400F,come earlier than expect  the performance is great  great buy
160,2023-06-01,5,24000,the United States,11400F,second  hand
161,2022-08-21,4,24000,the United States,11400F,i run this cpu with a 3070 ti  and it holds up with it well  very consistent and smooth performance out of this little cpu 
162,2023-01-16,5,24000,the United States,11400F,from one it is better to go for this instead of the i3 prices are already lower than before so this 6 cores 
163,2023-02-21,5,24000,the United States,11400F,my son is building his own computer i bought this for his birthday  he loved it
164,2023-01-30,5,24000,the United States,11400F,good experience the shipment  came quickly  the processor meets my needs and the price is agreed to the benefits it offers 
165,2022-08-07,5,24000,the United States,11400F,you will definitely get what you paid for  might not be able to carry some of the aaa titles but perform quite well in most of the games i play such as dota 2  poe  elden ring etc 
166,2022-07-17,5,24000,the United States,11400F,this was the cpu i chose for my first build  and it’s great  i waited 2 weeks to write a review cause i was case swapping  i must say  it’s easy to swap as well 
167,2022-06-16,5,24000,the United States,11400F,very well processor both to play and multitasking  the only thing i recommend that they do not use the stock dichipator if they are going to stress the cpu i recommend that you buy something descending how an hyper 212 or noctua
168,2023-04-20,5,24000,the United States,11400F,works great
169,2022-06-23,5,24000,the United States,11400F,the product is perfect  for my liking the dissipator is not very powerful so i decided to install an additional one  but by the processor as such  very good and efficient 
170,2022-04-03,5,24000,the United States,11400F,works as expected and is more than enough for gaming and regular pc tasks  great value for the performance and price 
171,2021-09-27,5,58500,India,11700K,i upgraded from i5 8th gen to i7 11th gen    this is super fast processor    got 75 fps on cod warzone 2k with 1060 gtx
172,2021-08-01,5,58500,India,11700K,working perfectly for gaming
173,2021-12-03,1,58500,India,11700K,dislike
174,2024-03-19,5,58500,Brazil,11700K,excelent  i recommend
175,2023-02-22,5,58500,Italy,11700K,item arrived wrong made the return everything ok
176,2023-12-18,5,58500,the United States,11700K,benchmarked paired with an evga geoforce 3080 rtx ti and score beat other rigs with same gpu but later series i7 and i9 cpus  idles in my rig at between 55° and 60° with air cooling but doesn t go beyond 82° when stress tested  i ve read where some people were concerned about it idling at 70° but it s rated to withstand 120°  so  a little warm  but high performing  definitely worth the sale price of  287  especially if you re used to spending around  350 for a new cpu  
177,2021-12-30,4,58500,Germany,11700K,satisfied 👌
178,2023-08-27,5,58500,Japan,11700K,it is operating normally without initial failure 
179,2022-06-22,5,58500,Canada,11700K,blazing fast gaming and workflow  easy to overclock  out performs mid range amd by miles  savings of hundreds compared to higher range amd processors needed to compete   motherboard choices are slightly more expensive but if you already spend 300 to 500 on a processor  what s another 200 vs 250    benchmarks higher than or equivalent to ryzen 7 and leagues faster than ryzen 5  sweet spot for cpu demanding games but not enough for the overclocking thread ripping queens though 
180,2023-09-27,5,58500,Mexico,11700K,it can be said  excellent benefits  at a good price 
181,2023-07-15,1,58500,Germany,11700K,play video i received the cpu as used goods after installation pc only switches and off and the cpu led lights up red i returned the processor back 
182,2024-04-14,5,58500,the United States,11700K,used this i7 11700k in my cougar mx331 mesh x case with msi z590 a pro atx motherboard  didn t like the price  241 00 very satisfied 
183,2022-01-07,5,58500,Italy,11700K,very fast
184,2023-04-13,5,58500,Brazil,11700K,very good  so far exceeding expectations 
185,2022-05-29,5,58500,the United Kingdom,11700K,i always use the i7 11700k for my builds as never really had any probs at all so why change stick to what works   the prices would be good to stay at the £280 mark instead of going up by £50 then down again in just 3 days what’s the point of that 
186,2022-07-26,5,58500,Canada,11700K,my motherboard mag z490 tomahawk doesn t support pcie 4x4 to take fully advantage of my ssd 980 pro drive m 2 nvme interface and gpu 3080  intel® core™ i7 11700k does  therefore was a no brainer to purchase this specific cpu as msi updated the motherboard bios to support intel gen 11  and as intel® core™ i7 11700k comes with integrated graphics  i use this to my advantage to run certain programs to run from my 3080 gpu and intel integrated graphics as i do with msfs 2020  i was concern with the cpu heat but it turns out that runs at 34 normal load with water cooler and 70 when running under heavy stress loads  very happy and satisficed with this purchase  100  recommended 
187,2022-09-26,1,58500,Germany,11700K,play video original packaging unsealed and processor missing
188,2022-10-13,5,58500,the United Kingdom,11700K,this processor is absolutely insane 
189,2022-05-22,5,58500,Japan,11700K,it works stably without any initial failure 
190,2023-01-14,5,58500,Brazil,11700K,in use  for now working to the satisfaction 
191,2023-06-19,5,58500,Mexico,11700K,excellent to play or do design jobs
192,2023-04-11,5,58500,the United States,11700K,great cpu  my computer boots faster than my monitor wakes up  programs open immediately and run well  the only down side to this cpu is that it eats 125 watts and produces quite a bit of heat  my case exhaust fans make noticeable noise keeping my case cool  having said that  with proper cooling it is easy to keep the cpu under 70 c  under heavy load mine runs 58 65  
193,2024-05-16,5,58500,Canada,11700K,replaced a core i5 with this  made cadworkx and bricscad respond much faster 
194,2023-02-24,5,58500,Brazil,11700K,top
195,2021-07-04,5,58500,Japan,11700K,from i7 4790 equipped pc to i7 11700k equipped pc  the first 11th generation cpu is installed on rog strix z590f and the pc is the first i heard that it was easy to have heat  so i tried to combine it in water  cooled  but it doesn t exceed 45 ° c at the moment  so if it s not a person who does a high load  can it be air  cooled if you don t do anything  it is about 36 ° c  the processing speed is quite fast with 32gb of memory 
196,2024-06-11,5,58500,the United States,11700K,as a warning  i have 0 to no knowledge about computers  i play a lot of pc games and decided with an upgraded gpu i did not want to bottleneck my pc so i upgraded  this cpu was a perfect purchase for me  was the best one i could get along with my 3060 ti  the installation process was easy  had to watch a youtube video for help   after watching the video i knew what to do and it took me 30 seconds  has treated me right for over 6 months  would highly recommend it to future buyers 
197,2023-12-11,5,58500,Canada,11700K,it works well  nice and fast
198,2021-08-07,5,58500,the United Kingdom,11700K,while amd i s dominating at the moment  intel is still good  either cpu is going to do you just fine  this 11700k was a bit cheaper  and it s plenty fast enough  easy to install 
199,2023-03-01,5,58500,Mexico,11700K,i worry a little the price but the little time i have used it has worked quite well
200,2024-05-24,5,58500,Canada,11700K,good processor without more who does the job
201,2021-10-30,5,58500,the United Kingdom,11700K,i bought this as a amazon repackaged cpu and works perfect no problems at all love it got a good discount on it too 
202,2024-06-17,5,58500,the United States,11700K,quality of the package excellent  amazon platform is precise  arrivals was fast  and product arrived safely  loved everything about it  on other terms  its unlocked so gaming is going to be blast  ease of use is in the instructions  i have an arc angel3 0 so cooling  and maintaining a good temperature should be great 
203,2023-04-23,4,58500,Japan,11700K,the original thing that was attached was a losing individual  it was discovered after the initial failure   but i arranged it for replacement because the problem appeared significantly 11700k and 11700 were different things  so it was difficult to understand this area i canceled it once  but when i was looking at the inquiry  i found out that it was the target product  so i ordered it again the product itself has arrived at 11700k  so there is no problem  but it is ★ 4 because it is difficult to understand the product name 
204,2024-01-27,5,58500,the United States,11700K,i decided to upgrade my motherboard with this 11th generation i7 11700k cpu from a i7 10700kf to bump overall performance as well as the gen 4 nvme m 2 ssd support  it took less time than i thought to remove the aio water cooling  swap out the 32gb of ddr4 for 64gb as well as installing the 2tb gen 4 ssd  i reassembled all of the disconnected components and powered back up into the bios  everything was recognized and playing nicely  performed a clean os install and am quite pleased with the outcome  i would definitely recommend for those that have a motherboard with an upgrade path  i think you will be happy you did 
205,2023-08-23,5,58500,Canada,11700K,excellent cpu  handles all the latest games my kids play and all the design work i throw at it  does not overheat but you need to use a quality io 
206,2021-12-17,5,58500,Mexico,11700K,very good processor  fast and functional the only detail is that as it does not bring a fan  i installed it by buying a cooler master rr 212s 20pk r1 hyper 212 and it was perfect 
207,2024-04-21,4,58500,the United Kingdom,11700K,before buying  i did a lot of research on what would be the best and quietest cpu cooler  as it generates almost two the amount of heat  i have only been using it for two months  but the improvement over a 10th gen i3 is significant  it is reliable so far   one star has been marked down because the chip is so overpriced  to be fair this is not the fault of amazon  as all suppliers seem to be overpricing these days when we are on the 14th gen 
208,2021-10-10,5,58500,Japan,11700K,i think it is a perfect product with specifications and prices 
209,2021-08-19,5,58500,the United Kingdom,11700K,arrived quicker than expected  looks brand new and no damage pins scratches
210,2021-04-01,5,58500,the United States,11700K,the i7 11700k 11th gen sits in between the well reviewed i5 and the poorly priced i9 11900k  i think at this price  i got it at pre launch sale of  399  it s a good product  it s cheaper than the 5800x  performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to overclock  rocket lake  11th gen  supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores  it also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake      1 45v load voltage supposedly safe according to reddit ama  although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved ipc  this actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests  gaming load is not bad at all i was seeing around 100w on horizon zero dawn  unless you want the highest overclocks  the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance  coming from the i9 10900k  the gaming fps is pretty similar at uw 1440p  but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking   as in you get watch dog bsod errors or you don’t   not the whea stuff  the ram gear stuff is a little overblown  the performance penalty of running 1 2 is not as bad as what you see on ryzen  you can run very high speed ram 4800  and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips  i m an enthusiast and i ve had ryzen and intel systems and i just enjoy tuning intel cpus  glad to be one of the first to review this  this came in as same day delivery  happy overclocking everyone 
211,2021-07-12,4,58500,Canada,11700K,there s no denying this is a strong processor and if you want to buy something from intel then this or the 6 core 11600k are the way to go   but if money is a consideration  or your power bill  or how much you need to spend on cooling  or what amd offers  well  you can do better  the similar amd 8 core is a bit more expensive but has cheaper motherboards and draws far less power which means a smaller power bill  a smaller power supply and cheaper cooling solutions   so  yes this processor is strong  i wanted to go intel and needed a processor right away so that s why i own one  but i feel like this is an offering to bridge the gap to the next generation 
212,2021-05-04,5,58500,Japan,11700K,it is stable and easy to use 
213,2021-10-24,5,58500,the United Kingdom,11700K,beats all i9
214,2022-08-15,3,58500,Japan,11700K,if you buy this  the lower cpu of the 12th generation is cheaper in performance 
215,2024-03-06,5,58500,the United States,11700K,very good processor nothing was wrong and now my pc is stronger
216,2024-03-17,5,58500,Canada,11700K,very satisfied
217,2024-01-29,5,58500,the United States,11700K,happy with my purchase
218,2021-04-14,5,58500,the United States,11700K,play video rates as ufo on user benchmark   is a very good cpu  for anyone who might wonder though it is not good for gaming unless you have a dedicated graphics card  so the person who answered my question   said it was great for no video card gaming on 1080p  they lied  any way i am running it with an rx 560 4gb right now on my uhd 52  tv on low settings unless video cards come back down to reasonable prices again   it works fine for the games i play  if you do not game or need use of powerful graphics its great for surfing the web  watching videos   streams  otherwise i advise you find or have a video card if you want to game or what ever   great cpu   update 04 09 2024   currently i run this cpu with 96gb ddr4 3200  rtx 3060 ti 8gb  500gb wdblack m2 as os drive  4tb m2 for games  1kw psu  i have 2x 240cfm fans on it  and 3 others to cool my system none of which i ever need to run about 25  air flow 
219,2021-09-10,5,58500,the United States,11700K,i know that there a lot of negative reviews for these 11th gen intel chips but so far  it s just what i needed  my computer was dying  i put this chip on an asus board and i have had zero problems  other than my old graphics card dying a few weeks later  intel saved the day  i can t play my full steam library  but i can use a good 85   i can do everything else that i normally do without any overheating or slowdowns  now i can wait for a while to see if graphics cards go on sale  update 10 18 21  i ve been going through my games 450   and so far i can play them all  to name a few  grim dawn divinity original sin  trials of mana  and book of demons  no separate graphics card at all  as far as i m concerned  this processor is well worth the money  a big thank you to intel for helping us regular folks beat the scalpers  let  em choke on those triple priced cards 
220,2021-04-05,5,58500,the United States,11700K,may 2021  sometime   i decided the processor  i don t recommend you do that   it required a oven and a lot of patience  long story short after delidding and applying liquid metal it dropped my temps over 10c  i ran it that way for about 6 months before selling it to a friend but he hasn t had any issues yet either april 12  2021 for some reason my cpu is now shooting up to 100c the moment i do a stress test  within less than 2 seconds  causing it to throttle tremendously  i have changed nothing  i reseated my cooler thinking maybe it had shifted and that still didn t fix it  i am going to check through everything today  maybe something changed in my bios for some reason  if this can t be fixed i ll be sending it back or warrantying it  so far so good  i ve been able to run this at 5 2ghz on all cores for quite a while  gets a little warm but nothing that isn t manageable  seems like all the 1 star reviews are just people who like to comment on things they don t own 
221,2023-10-05,5,58500,the United States,11700K,easy to install in my msi motherboard and good for the money that i spent on it  it works great so far no issues as of yet 
222,2023-04-10,5,58500,the United States,11700K,great cpu using it as intended by intel everything is stock so it s running 125 watts i did use an auto oc at first and it used almost 180 watts and was hotter disabling in my case on my asus motherboard the asus performance enhancement my temps under load are 60c   with enabled it hit in the mid 70s and i didn t notice any difference in performance   good cpu  all core boost is 4 6 few cores are 5ghz so running as advertised 😍
223,2023-10-05,5,58500,Canada,11700K,i bought this processor because it supports pcie 4 0 buy with this processor a good cpu cooler because during updates the cpu rose up to 90 celsius so i changed my cooler for a be quiet dark rock pro 4 on amazon and now my intel cpu displays 31 degree celsius 
224,2022-06-09,5,58500,the United States,11700K,don t listen to the review on youtube  cus this is a legendary cpu  before the 11th gen  the 10900k was the fastest gaming cpu in the market  and for intel to top it  is impressive in itself  cpu if you pair it with the right motherboard and rams you will then see its full potential  i own the 12900k for over 6 months and decided to go back to the 11gen  even though alder lake is more powerful  since it is very new  it has way too many drawback and the high latency of rams is the main reason why i decided to sell it  i think raptor lake would be the cpu but as of now  the 11 gen with a few tweaks will outperform alder lake 
225,2023-05-19,4,58500,the United States,11700K,i must say that this might not be a high end cpu but does the job pretty damn fine 
226,2022-10-08,5,58500,the United States,11700K,now with the i9 13900 series coming out this is two steps down from the top of the procesor market  it was just published that the new line was tested to 8 3gh  this line becomes the third choice and the i5 s the  poor cousins   this processor still computes fine and can be used if you need to save some money or where speed really is not an issue 
227,2023-08-10,5,58500,the United States,11700K,works well with my 2080 super  blazing fast doing work and internet duties   good value 
228,2021-05-06,4,58500,the United States,11700K,great for gaming  even tho amd beats it in multi core workloads doesn t mean it s not a good processor  it s a stable reliable processor  and best of all it s in stock  in gaming it trades blows with my ryzen 5800x  so for i haven t run into any bugs or glitches  that s what you get with intel  stability  if your only gaming i d say this isn t the way to go  but my wife does do work station application and the extra cores reduce her time  i d say this is niche processor and very few people would actually benefit from the extra cores  if your just gaming go with a 11600k  my daughter build is running an overclocked 11600k and it trades blows with this one 
229,2023-06-22,5,58500,the United States,11700K,when you have this beast with the most top hardware of the moment you can see the true power of this processor
230,2023-07-19,5,58500,the United States,11700K,this cpu has been absolutely amazing i have yet to get it to bog down
231,2023-03-28,5,58500,the United States,11700K,need to use a water aio at least or your pc will become a oven at times  but it s plenty fast enough for whatever your needs are and the prices have finally started to drop on the 11th gen 
232,2021-05-21,5,58500,the United States,11700K,my first upgrade since generation 4 i5 4670k  it s fantastic  i chose an asus z590 prime  corsair capallex 110  rm 650w psu  a learning curve on overclocking since 2010  i spent equally as much in ram  mobo and cooling but worth every cent  you ll still need graphics if running under geforce 1000 series  but my perfermance with a 960gtx is phenomenal  its an intel entusiasts dream  and i agree  ignore the one star reviews  i won t make a ryzen comparison  other than my title  i do believe amd is doing less with more changes but just my opinion  are threads  cores and nanometers winning  i have my doubts  nonetheless this is intel back on it s game 
233,2021-05-21,5,58500,the United States,11700K,wonderfully designed cpu  for those that want low power consumption and low temps just leave it stock  the 3 6 ghz to 5 0 boost is designed to make this processor the swiss army knife of cpus  overclocks to 5 1 all core easily on the z590 motherboards  yes it runs warm but you wanted an excuse to buy that 360mm aio  two cores can overclock to 5 2 if desired  probably could get all 8 pretty close to that with an open loop system  scores 116 118  on userbenchmarks  i like amd but they just don t overclock as well  plus this processor is readily available at retail price  some of the hate surrounding this offering is extremely misguided 
234,2023-11-16,3,58500,the United States,11700K,like the product  system is half together  i have 3 others to put together 
235,2022-03-08,5,58500,the United States,11700K,when rebuilding my failed desktop computer i had to buy a new motherboard which would not accomodate my previous cpu chip  i researched an i9 core but it really wasn t faster enough to spend the extra cash on one   this i7 works great  i do mostly photo editing with some video editing  the only  game  i run is microsoft flight simulator 2020 which runs at almost the maximum settings 
236,2022-08-23,5,58500,the United States,11700K,despite the stigma with the 11th gen cpus  the performance of the 11700k is definitely worth going for  the only scenario i would say it s not recommended is if the 12600k 12700k is available for a close price  in which case one would have to account for the additional cost with the z690 motherboards as well as ddr5 if that s the choice 
237,2023-07-19,5,58500,Canada,11700K,i’m quite happy with this cpu  i’m not a computer person  just built a gaming pc  this arrived fast and was well packaged 
238,2023-06-13,5,58500,the United States,11700K,play video no picture of the actual cpu but my build is running great 
239,2023-07-30,5,58500,the United States,11700K,works as expected
240,2021-06-08,5,58500,the United States,11700K,love this cpu  paired with a z590 motherboard  the gen 4 support is a must have but this cpu also does not sacrifice any performance as well  this is also paired with an rtx 3070 in my system and i could not be happier  i have it pinged at 5 0 ghz and it has not let me down at all  definitely have so much more room to overclock if i want too which is nice  this cpu is very stable and i think the best value in terms of price to performance on the intel 11th gen lineup 
241,2022-04-30,4,58500,the United States,11700K,for some reason it wouldn’t allow me to unlock the raid capability on my motherboard since this model was made to do that  tested with someone else’s 11700 it raid could be enabled  i wouldn’t buy it here  look elsewhere for it  it’s too expensive to risk something like this 
242,2022-07-07,5,58500,the United States,11700K,excellent cpu was worried  for the comments on the internet about that it heats a lot  but i almost have it a month and its base temperature is 28 ° c to 36 ° c performing tasks or so heavy or so basic note i do not use it to play  nor have i made overclock  but it goes wonderfully 
243,2022-02-03,4,58500,the United States,11700K,if you have a lga1200 platform this is my recommendation for a high performance gaming cpu  the 11th gen i9 is essentially just a binned and more expensive version of this  otherwise you can go 10900k for slightly lower single core performance but more physical cores 
244,2023-02-23,5,58500,the United States,11700K,good product  works perfectly in my build and powerful enough  probably more than needed  to do what i want on my pc 
245,2022-05-04,5,58500,the United States,11700K,transport went okay  i was afraid of a dent in package but cpu was intact without damage it seems   cpu is plugged in and working  giving it a few days to warm up before i want to clock to okay performance   all in all 8 10 stars
246,2023-04-09,5,58500,the United States,11700K,kept up on all games
247,2021-06-25,5,58500,the United States,11700K,when compared to the i9 11900k  this one just provides much more value  the integrated graphics are decent enough for light gaming on games such as league of legends and provides a nice backup graphics in the event that the gpu fails  i would definitely appreciate more cores on it  but all in all  its a pretty good upgrade from my previous 7th gen intel pc 
248,2021-07-16,5,58500,the United States,11700K,very good processor  i wanted to wait for generation 12 but it would be the same because later i would like to wait for generation 13 and i will never buy any  this 11 for the games is luxurious for a long time  i did a multi core effort test and the temperaturemaximo is 74 degrees  if you are a person who likes to play i recommend this cpu 
249,2022-05-19,4,58500,Canada,11700K,recently upgraded from the intel i5 9600k  which was starting to bottleneck when playing newer games  what a huge difference  love this processor 
250,2021-07-14,5,58500,the United States,11700K,i bought the 11700k for my gaming rig  with water cooling i’ve got it overclocked to 4 7ghz on all cores  totally stable and never gets hotter than 60 c  with my 1080 ti it runs all games i’ve played on max settings with a minimum of 80fps at 2k ultrawide  and much higher for most games  including cyberpunk and assassins creed valhalla 
251,2021-10-19,5,58500,the United States,11700K,for the price i couldn’t be happier  this cpu is an absolute mammoth for an i7  just research the specs and order with confidence  i have it cooled with a water pump heat sync and the temps stay 25 30c during idle and increase to a steady 45 55c during constant loads  great product  great value 
252,2022-06-06,3,58500,the United States,11700K,this is supposedly a brand new cpu but i saw an orange scratch mark  likely whatever plating was slightly scratched off to expose a copper surface  i just don t think thats acceptable for a 300  dollar cpu  i could buy an xbox series x for that price and what i got was a maybe used cpu that was run around the ring a few times  it works but disappointed with quality and the thought that i mightve bought a used cpu for over 300 dollars 
253,2022-12-15,5,58500,Canada,11700K,i started from an i5 10600k on this i7 11 700k to be able to play and stream on a very good upgrade pc
254,2021-09-12,5,58500,the United States,11700K,8 cores at this price  these are amazing cpus without breaking the wallet  these prices used to be the price of quad core cpus  so if you want the best bang for your bucks and not go with amd  these are it  ocs well  runs at reasonable temperatures  excellent processor 
255,2023-03-23,5,58500,Canada,11700K,it’s working fine right now will see
256,2022-04-27,5,58500,the United States,11700K,this is a massive improvement from the i7 8700k  it runs faster and at 20 celsius lower temperature with a higher overclock  the additional cores make it useful for productivity as well as gaming 
257,2021-06-04,4,58500,the United States,11700K,i watched a lot of reviews on this chip and they all say it’s trash  i mean  maybe some older gen chips work just as well and are cheaper but i’m averaging 4 9 to 5 ghz while playing warzone 
258,2022-02-28,4,58500,the United States,11700K,be sure you have adequate cooling if you plan on over clocking  nuf said 
259,2022-05-02,5,58500,the United States,11700K,it is an 8 nucleus processor which meets various tasks in 2022  i bought it to work autocad  revit  and 3dsmax
260,2021-05-27,5,58500,the United States,11700K,installation was a breeze  my first   i have only had it in place for a month and have not yet been able to get a decent graphics card  but running with an old card for now does not come close to pushing this cpu to it s limits 
261,2024-03-09,3,80000,India,11900K,overheating
262,2021-05-02,1,80000,India,11900K,original price is 45k here its selling at 85k 10th gen is better in performance   or buy amd 5000 series  don t buy  this is scam computer parts in india is now a scam market
263,2024-03-10,5,80000,the United States,11900K,upgraded from a 9900k and had a hotter running pc  couldn t figure it out at first and found myself checking my aio  reapplying thermal paste  checking settings  etc  after research i was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps  what ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the performance menu   in those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99  my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80 85  this tuning comes without a noticeable hit on fps except while playing  squad   a single core use cpu intensive game   with that game i do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99   this is not that big of a deal as i can easily tick it up to 100  for squad and just put up with the 75 80 temps   happy that i can at least play most of my games at a good temp while gaining good performance by this upgrade 
264,2022-03-26,5,80000,Germany,11900K,no issue with cpu works  temps are fine for workload 
265,2022-07-11,4,80000,Brazil,11900K,and it has arrived on the right time  but in a different box from the photo processor is good  but only cooled with water cooler 
266,2023-03-27,5,80000,France,11900K,super
267,2024-06-15,5,80000,Canada,11900K,perfect for what son needs it for  he’s a gamer and work from home  so it’s good so far  no complaints at all  although it has been a few months of usage 
268,2022-10-04,5,80000,Australia,11900K,just buy the last gen over the current 12th gen  its heaps better value especially when factoring ram costs and motherboard costs 
269,2023-07-17,5,80000,Singapore,11900K,this i9 was my first i9 series ever used since extreme processor  works great and sync well with rtx 3080ti without bottleneck it 
270,2024-04-28,5,80000,Canada,11900K,the intel core i9 11900k desktop processor is a powerhouse  with 8 cores and speeds up to 5 3 ghz  it s a beast for any task  plus  being unlocked  you have the freedom to overclock for even more performance  it s the best cpu my motherboard can handle  and i couldn t be happier with its performance  you really can t beat it 
271,2022-03-02,5,80000,Mexico,11900K,the product works perfectly 
272,2024-03-01,5,80000,the United States,11900K,when i was in the market to create a pc  this cpu was top of the line  and i got it  and it has not disappointed me ever since  works great and keeps on working  i have overclocked it and underclocked it  stress tested it for a few hours  and it managed to keep running  i love my pc and this cpu 
273,2021-12-08,5,80000,Germany,11900K,no comment
274,2022-07-19,5,80000,Singapore,11900K,comes in the cardboard box not plastic  sadly  so do expect shipping to cause rhe box to get dents  cpu works fine though but for those who are running z490 boards  do update your bios and disable gen 4 pcie or it may cause issues w booting 
275,2023-02-02,5,80000,France,11900K,perfect product works at the top
276,2023-10-03,5,80000,the United States,11900K,this was intel s top line cpu in the 11th generation  it used the lga 1200 socket which was only minimally different from the lga 1151 socket  1200 pins vs  1151 pins   the motherboards for the lga 1200 required only small changes in production spec  and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the lga 1200  by contrast  the 12th generation  using the lga 1700 socket  required an extensive redesign of motherboards  and the coolers that got adapted over from the lga 1151 1200 didn t really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation intel cpus  this i9 11900k will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100   and that s right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today 
277,2023-04-03,5,80000,the United Kingdom,11900K,im mostly just confused why the free heatsink thats not designed for this cpu that is known to run extremely hot     also  saddened by the lack of a fancy looking intel box  d
278,2023-11-06,1,80000,France,11900K,on paper  it is a very good cpu that i recommend to anyone however  having bought it from this seller  i have only had problems since i received it the packaging was not the blue box you see in the photos but a cardboard packaging with foam  probably supplied by amazon  with just the cpu inside  in direct contact of the foam not immediately but a little after its installation  after the warranty period  as if by chance   the cpu is now almost unusable  since the computer is constantly 100  use of it  or works correctly with100 peaks worse still  playing games is a torture  since the pc is simply freeze and crash when it wishes  with this damn cpu if you want to buy this cpu at all costs  do not do it here  go through a real seller with a follow  up and a guarantee  or you will throw hundreds of euros by the window 
279,2023-08-27,4,80000,Mexico,11900K,play video has been a battle processor  i use my workstation mainly for multimedia edition and so far the processor has been able to with everything  premiere  after  photoshop  davinci  audition for the current price  august 2023   it is worth it 
280,2023-02-23,4,80000,Italy,11900K,excellent processor it requires a good heat dissipation system 
281,2021-11-20,5,80000,Canada,11900K,eng  if you know how to properly overclock it you can run at 5ghz with air collected i got 40 on idle and 49 on heavy loads does is better than 12th gen for now yes  but why only becuse the 12th des a lot more heat and energy consumption and it s not stable for the moment fr  good cpu you can overclock at 5ghz manually and surely more is it better known than the i9 12900k yes because the 12th gen is not yet stable donc with the 12th gen you consume more energy so you go ride warmer without counting the current bugs 😀
282,2023-07-21,3,80000,Mexico,11900K,the product arrived with a basic intel box and not with the box presented in the publication disappointing for the price 
283,2024-04-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,i am not a gamer by a long shot  but wanted a powerful intel based cpu riding on an  asus maximus extreme motherboard  along with a asus rtx 4090 gpu  i purchased  1  of the most graphic intensive aaa game titles and a few cpu intensive military strategy simulation games known for their heavy demand for cpu physics computations  my core i9 11900k which i purchased in 2022 performed admirably well on all accounts  absolutely no complaints  some reports say that the i9 11900k runs hot and sometimes above the 100°c mark  but that was not really the case with me or the many others when they installed a high quality 360mm or above sized aio water cooler  my very demanding combat simulation  command  modern operations  never presented a heating issue with the i9 11900k and with my over 80 hours of heavy duty play  for good measure my cosmos c700m eatx case also includes a total of  7  additional independent noctua cooling fans  which of course benefits the cooling within the massive interior of the enclosure  overall i am extremely satisfied with intel in general and recommend the i9 11900k and or its newer siblings now as a very good buy 
284,2022-09-09,5,80000,the United Kingdom,11900K,amazing product  and the shipping was excellent  however the box in the image isnt what you get in person  its just the standard box you usually get 
285,2023-11-09,5,80000,Canada,11900K,very good
286,2024-02-27,1,80000,Mexico,11900K,the box came very fast as many report is not the original does not bring the booklet or the plate of i9 silver the processor is from those of bulk that is sold to large companies for its assembly the used and scratched dicipador will be tested for a few days to theless fault goes back
287,2024-01-31,5,80000,the United States,11900K,this lga 1200 cpu is robust and easy to overclock assuming your motherboard supports overclocking and your cpu cooler supports it  the base 3 5 ghz can easily support overclocking to 5ghz  i used the intel windows overclocking program and it was easy to do  the cpu installs easily and runs well 
288,2023-09-04,5,80000,Canada,11900K,worked great in my home built pc 
289,2022-08-01,1,80000,the United Kingdom,11900K,box is not like on photos
290,2022-10-03,4,80000,Mexico,11900K,all good so much the product  it came in the classic cardboard packaging which disappointed me a little since i liked the plastic  but when installing it it runs great 
291,2022-07-26,1,80000,the United Kingdom,11900K,overpriced
292,2023-12-04,5,80000,the United States,11900K,i had an i7 10700 that went kaput on me  so i figured  why not upgrade to the overclockable 11900k  since it was only about 50 bucks more to the the fastest cpu my mobo can handle  i did install water cooling because it does run warm  but let’s just say this  my computer now works at warp 9 975  with the i9 10900k  a nvidia 3060 12gb  and 128 gb ddr4 at 3200mhz  on userbenchmark website the lowest score i got was a 104  for gaming  ufo ranking   i overclock it a lot and it holds up well  and stays under 50c with the water cooling for me   11 10  would recommend  promote ahead of peers 
293,2024-04-10,4,80000,Canada,11900K,woulda given 5 starts but it didn’t come in the blue box instead came in a cardboard box with a stock cpu fan that would never keep this thing cool for gaming and original packing doesn’t come with a cpu fan dont even know if it’s new or used  so be aware  you need an aio or a really good air cooler  but cpuz is reading i9 11900k  so that’s good 
294,2022-08-13,5,80000,Canada,11900K,i have finally changed my 6700k  so far i love it  with a good cooling it is super stable i have nothing negative to say
295,2024-01-28,4,80000,the United States,11900K,i thought it would come in the same box that is shown in the photo but it was not so bad  but it arrived excellent
296,2024-05-19,1,80000,Canada,11900K,after a week  cpu self reboots halts  we ve compared it with another cpu which exhibits no such issues  called intel   they suggested returning it  package is diff  than amzao s picture  
297,2023-03-20,1,80000,Mexico,11900K,the cpu is used  it came in an open box  without stamps  battered and dirty  obviously it did not come in the box that is shown in the publication  which disappointment  a new product is being bought nothing cheap
298,2022-10-16,5,80000,the United States,11900K,when i upgraded my desktop i decided to go intel core i9 this time  all my previous build was a 6th generation core i7 6700k  it ran fine but it wasnt up to running windows 11  so an upgrade was in order  besides  my old board was starting to fail  i originally bought a 10th generation core i9 10 core but that cpu was junk  there wasnt enough pci e lanes to support my drives and usb devices  this is a limitation of 10th generation cpus not a limitation on the board  my video card  rtx 3070  took up most of the available pci e lanes which took out most of my drives  so i went to the 11th generation i9 8 core instead  very happy with it  it solved all my pci e lane issues  i am able to run all my devices and drives  the cpu clocks at 5 3ghz stable i have water cooling installed  i see zero problems with this chip  its fast  its stable im plenty happy with the upgrade  the board is a msi meg z590 ace gold  i have 64gb ddr4 3200 
299,2024-03-18,3,80000,the United States,11900K,a great processor for my pc to complete its upgrade  highest compatible for my motherboard   but even with water cooling  it was running too hot  my computer would need to shutdown  swapped back to my i7 10700 with no issues   while my computer was running the i9  it made everything very optimized  including being able to utilize my 4070 graphics card to its fullest  i may get another one to try again  heard these can vary slightly on production 
300,2024-03-15,3,80000,the United States,11900K,play video honestly i put this qualification  because the article arrived in another box that is not the original  which reduces the credibility of the article  but arrived sealed hopefully and work when you decide to use it 
301,2021-07-14,5,80000,the United States,11900K,if seen too many of these new i9 s and i7 s put in b550 boards or anything with an lga 1200 slot and its a waste  this is the newest of the new guys  if you get this cpu do it proper  if youre not gonna shoot for utilizing its capabilities then get a 10th gen and save money  youre gonna need a new board  water cool this thing  gen 4 nvme drive  new 30 series gpu s  cause they utilize gen 4 pci e slots  heres a simple breakdown of a good starting point when getting this cpu   step 1  get an 11th gen processor  this i9 if its in your budget  step 2  get a motherboard with gen 4 pcie slots  z590 e was my go to  step 3  obviously water cool this unlocked beauty cause it d be a shame not to get it to 5 3ghz  done safely with corsair s h150i elite capellix  hovers around 40 s in degrees celsius  step 4  get a gen 4 nvme solid slate drive  might as well go samsung 980 pro for the 7000mb s reads  step 5  enjoy windows booting and being able to start opening webpages and games within 5 seconds of pressing the power button and never waiting for anything to load ever again 🙌🙏  ⚡ this is the future ⚡
302,2024-01-09,5,80000,the United States,11900K,had this for a while and it s performing like it should  would buy it again 
303,2021-07-24,5,80000,the United States,11900K,the seller did an amazing job  the item came even sooner than expected  the bad news is that i installed it in my previously flawless running machine  the reason i upgraded from my current i910900k is that i wanted to enable the nvme 2 4 0 on my ssd  i already had the drive and a z590 motherboard so why not right  i put the new i9 11900k in and it started and enabled the 4 0 on my nvme  yay right  literally with in a couple minutes i received a watchdog timeout error   this is caused by cpu cores failing to communicate with each other   i called intel tech support who was less than help full  i updated all drivers and still didn t work  i did notice my cpu temp was running over 100c  odd because i have the best nactura cpu cooler they sell  i decided to upgrade to a liquid cpu cooler and that brought my cpu temp down to around 85c  that still didn t fix the time out errors  i put my old cpu back and all is happy  i ended up sending the i9 11900k back but at least my i9 10900k is nice and cool even at 45  overclock  lol
304,2022-08-29,4,80000,the United States,11900K,the tenth gen i9 is better than this one  but i got it because my mobo needed it for the m 2 slot to work  that being said  we re talking about small performance differences in top of the line components  so it s not a big deal  with this thing being  650 without a sale i would never buy it because i can get an i7 from the same gen or previous and it will be just as good  i will say that the photo is deceptive  it does not come in the package on the photo with the cool blue plastic box  it will come in a cardboard box like any other cpu  overall it s still a great cpu and is a great upgrade from my previous i5 8600k  but not the absolute best and not worth paying  600 for 
305,2022-10-07,4,80000,the United States,11900K,cpu is great  not a bad deal if you are building a budget oriented high end pc  performance is similar to the 10900k but has the pcie gen 4 support which is the only justification for this cpu existance  this with a new z590 and depending if you already have ddr4 ram  this is 1 3 the cost of a new 12th existence  i will admit i am very disappointed in the box  the nice fancy one pictured is not the one sent  instead you will receive your processor in a small cardboard box with intel branding  it should be make clear that the box in the picture will not be arriving in the description or by updating the imgages 
306,2023-03-30,5,80000,the United States,11900K,products operates as expected  but they shipped this really oddly  it was first shipped ups  and stayed in a picked up status for 2 days  then a day or so later  delivered to usps  sat in des moines ia for 4 days  then it crawled to me well after predicted time  don t ship this way  its the worst way too ship  also you shipped it in a thin bubble wrap bag  should have been in a box  its a fragile chip  but thank you for a good working product with no issues as of yet 
307,2022-09-06,5,80000,the United States,11900K,i purchased this cpu during one of amazon s infrequent and short lived major price reductions  i paid  301 99 for the cpu at the time when it was selling for  389 99  i wanted pcie 4 0 and thunderbolt 4 0 and i was considering a 5900x but i found the amd x570 motherboard feature sets to be disappointing even at the high end  anyway  i usually buy intel processors although i ve occasionally bought amd in the past  i have a very good cooler master masterliquid ml360 cpu liquid cooler which keeps the temperatures reasonably cool  i also bought an asus z590 maximus xiii hero motherboard  everything is faster with this cpu and motherboard  from storage to graphics 
308,2022-11-26,5,80000,the United States,11900K,having eight cores and hyperthreading makes for a very powerful processor  this is a very good  overkill  processor  that is to say  if you get this you ll outpace software for several years  it also has onboard graphics  so if you re buying this for rendering and just light computing  you ll be okay and won t have to buy a discrete graphics card like a geforce   that said  this thing can sometimes get warm under heavy use  so a cooler is recommended  i use a liquid cooler  but if you re not using it for heavy gaming  you can get away with just a fan   overall  10 10 
309,2023-04-28,5,80000,the United States,11900K,as others stated it is not in the box being shown  so the advertised product is not what you get   however the good thing is the box doesnt mean squat to how it runs  just grabbed this to upgrade my system from a 10th gen i9 to this  only difference really is faster pcie slots on my board  this would depend on your board  and opens up an additional nvme drive 
310,2023-09-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,been using this cpu for about a year works great   seen some reviews about the box issue but i received mine in the official intel box 
311,2023-08-11,5,80000,the United States,11900K,the processor was delivered in just a cardboard box rather the official box shown in the listing  but other than that it works just fine and is exactly what i wanted 
312,2023-09-28,5,80000,the United States,11900K,came in correct box and arrived earlier than expected works perfectly aswell
313,2022-12-14,4,80000,the United States,11900K,this cpu is hot and i don t just mean fast  it runs pretty hot even with liquid cooling  but with the right mb  cooling and ram i think 5ghz may be reachable  pushing it but reachable 
314,2022-07-25,5,80000,the United States,11900K,so far i’m really liking this cpu  i purchased it on prime day for  300 which imo isn’t too bad compared to what it used to be and how expensive the 12 gen cpus are   paired it with the z590 asus strix e that i got for  200 on prime days  it’s working out pretty well   also threw in the 3600 cl16 ram with it as this ram apparently runs well with it   overall i’m pretty happy with this purchase
315,2022-11-17,5,80000,the United States,11900K,installed the i9 11900k in the asus prime z590 p wifi6 with team group ddr4 3200 cl14 and asus rtx 2070 has this computer running less than a whisper of sound i mean even when the pc ramps up to 5 3ghz then you hear still a whisper from all fans you really need to pay attention to the pc to even notice any sound at all 
316,2021-06-19,4,80000,the United States,11900K,this cpu is fast for gaming but for some reason it was crashing i check everything on my rig to be compatible and it was  put a different cpu and problems are gone am not sure if it was defective or what but other than the crashing out of nowhere with the one i had excellent cpu  now let’s see how it goes with the return will edit once everything is handled i had a little experience with amazon that i dnt wish to no body still waiting on that for few months already
317,2021-06-03,5,80000,the United States,11900K,this cpu is fast  really fast  remove the power limits and let it s boost algorithms take over and it will blow your socks off  you will need a good aio or really beefy air cooler  or obviously a custom loop   i went with the cooler master masterliquid ml240 illusion  ordered an extra 2 of the hallo fans and set it up in a push pull and under stress test8ng it stays in the 80s  with all power limits removed  while gaming it is usually in the 50 s and occasionally the 60 s if it is really intense   it is a tad on the pricey end but you want almost the same performance for less grab the 11700k
318,2023-02-20,4,80000,the United States,11900K,4 star because i didn t get the fancy box
319,2022-09-11,5,80000,the United States,11900K,right now the best processors out there  in a few months i m sure there will be better ones  remember we are always buying guaranteed to become obsolete components for our computers  unless they became technically  obsolete  all the manufacturers would go out of business  sorry  it s the way of the world 
320,2023-08-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,good product except for freight charges being costly 
321,2021-08-26,1,80000,the United States,11900K,it does not worth buying this cpu  it is really expensive  i would expect it to be a good performance and good quality cpu and has good service  but it doesn t match my expectations  it is broken 10 days after i used it  my computer was certainly not able to open  after i google the issues and take it to a computer store  it seems like the cpu is broken and there are many defective merchandises in this product  so far  i am not happy but still can convince myself that i am just not lucky even i feel ridiculous about why such expensive items have so many defective products  i tried to use the warranty to get a new one or fix it  but intel s customer service is ridiculous slow  after we tell them the issue  it has been a month and they are still verifying our information  it took them 4 days to reply us and told us what info they need  we sent them the information immediately  it took another 4 days to tell us that one of the information is wrong  we gave them the correct information immediately  this time  it took 10 days to tell us that purchase information is good  but they need the account holder to authorize the warranty  why do not you tell us this at beginning    after this  it has been several days and we still wait for the reply now  i do not understand why it takes so many days to just verify the customer information  should not this be done in 1 days or even 1 hour  i understand it takes time to reply and communicate cross teams  but it still takes too long time  especially  this is a high price item  it should have proper quality and service for this price 
322,2022-09-25,5,80000,the United States,11900K,got this on sale for 46  off a couple weeks ago and it made such a fantastic performance increase from my i7 7700k  paired it with a msi z590 a pro series motherboard  32 gb ddr4 3200 mhz ram  msi ventus 2x 3060 ti gpu  and a cooler master 240l water cooling system and it s been absolutely incredible 
323,2023-05-20,5,80000,the United States,11900K,i wish intel would end this  upgrade or die  philosophy it really makes me unhappy  my mom s cool with it tho 
324,2023-03-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,excellent to work to play and demand the maximum of the processor  i had to update my mainboard  z590  to take advantage of all the resources of the easy to install processor  if i recommend installing a good dissipator because it tends to heat up 
325,2022-07-15,5,80000,the United States,11900K,runs flawlessly on default settings on this rog strix z590 e  it over clocks itself to 5 3ghz all core if you really need it  paired it with a corsair h100i 240mm and it doesn t go above 65c during heavy gaming  if you re going to overclock it i suggest a 360mm aio or custom loop 
326,2022-07-13,5,80000,the United States,11900K,i added this intel core i9 11900k desktop processor to my new  rog maximus xiii hero motherboard  a year ago  it is a perfect combination for what i wanted   gaming in vr   i haven t needed tech support so that says a lot about the quality of this and the motherboard working together 
327,2022-09-22,4,80000,the United States,11900K,does not come with the fancy box  does not come with a cpu fan that comes with the fancy box  it s bare bones 
328,2024-01-14,2,80000,the United States,11900K,the cpu worked and it is an 11900k but it came in a regular brown box not an intel box which was concerning as it may be used 
329,2023-01-06,3,80000,the United States,11900K,i ve had this cpu since april of 2022 and just the other day my pc would only start the fans and the lights in the pc  after switching some parts and testing it turned out the cpu has gone bad  it did perform well while it was working but for a cpu that was not overclocked or used for anything more than gaming it shouldn t go bad like this 
330,2022-04-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,just upgraded my pcs motherboard so i figured might as well get a new processor while im at it  so far the difference is immense  my pc boots faster than its monitor can turn on and playing games at max settings with unlocked framerates causes 0 stress on my rig now  so far soooo good 
331,2023-05-28,3,80000,the United States,11900K,i was sent a lose used possessor in a box  annoyed  but no choice apparently 
332,2022-04-20,5,80000,the United States,11900K,constantly running around 45 65c max full load gaming with 240mm aio from nzxt  this holds 4 9 5 2 ghz constantly i may have won the silicon lotto  this runs 1440p games yawning with a 3080ti maybe 50 60 percent utilization under heavy games  if you don’t want to go 12th gen this is your cpu 
333,2022-09-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,at one time  i thought this i9 11900k could not be used  after cross testing with multiple pcs  it can finally be used  this cpu was purchased at a special price  the cp value is very high  and the seller sends it quickly 
334,2022-08-15,5,80000,the United States,11900K,i waited a year for this processor it was worth the wait coming off a fx chip  delivery was in less then a day only 10 hours biting my nails couldn t wait to get this chip
335,2021-10-18,4,80000,Canada,11900K,a bit expensive   powerful  but runs very hot  to the point you might crash your pc due to heat 
336,2022-10-16,5,80000,Canada,11900K,upgraded from i5    lol what a friggin improvement    wow video editing sure isn t an issue now  blows my mind
337,2022-09-28,5,80000,the United States,11900K,my daughter needs new computer system  so  i try this cpu for her computer  so far so good 
338,2022-08-09,5,80000,the United States,11900K,great cpu  super fast and great overclocking  paired it with a quality aio and it keeps the temps down 
339,2022-09-09,5,80000,the United States,11900K,built a good spec pc with this cpu and asus z 590 e gaming board  works like a dream
340,2023-02-13,5,80000,the United States,11900K,very powerful cpu  great product 
341,2022-03-05,5,80000,the United States,11900K,i9 is outrageous  better benchmarks than my old pc that had an older 5 0ghz amd  older am3  socket  with crossfire r9 390x  shipping was next day  arrived new 
342,2021-11-08,3,80000,the United States,11900K,good for gaming  definitely runs hot  even a 360mm aio can’t keep it cool with abt enabled  frequently hits 100c when stress testing with abt on avx loads  during gaming with abt with a 350mm aio 50 70c  also has an issue that the cores report 0c when in c states  intel says there’s a “fix” coming but there’s no official timeline 
343,2022-07-05,5,80000,the United States,11900K,exactly what i needed for my pc build  this item is amazing  and performs even better
344,2021-06-04,5,80000,the United States,11900K,not sure why there are so few reviews for this product  also not sure why it s listed under motherboards  it s an amazing cpu for gaming and lightly threaded workloads  don t listen to reviews about it not working or being too hot  people are just bad mounting coolers and making sure the socket fits 
345,2022-07-13,5,80000,the United States,11900K,to date the cpu works very well for what ever you want it to do 
346,2021-11-23,5,80000,the United States,11900K,intel quality is an industry standard  in my eyes    this is no exception  installation and setup were easy and a good speed bump  windows 11 seems to love it 
347,2022-10-11,5,80000,the United States,11900K,was an amd guy  now i m an intel believer 
348,2022-02-11,5,80000,the United States,11900K,great processor if you want to use pci e 4 0 features like your samsung pro 980 nvme 4 0 ssd or pci e 4 0 compatible video cards 
349,2022-08-18,5,80000,the United States,11900K,runs like it should  pops on everything  solid
350,2023-12-31,1,80000,the United States,11900K,i have a gigabyte z490 arorus motherboard  its supports nvme pcie gen 4 and pcie 16x with 11th gen intel  i got this because the 10700k was bottlenecking my gpu  swap was easy but as soon as the pc went under full load it blue screened  would not boot until i put the 10700k back in  immediately returned
351,2023-06-25,5,14500,India,12100F,if you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives  this cpu is by no means a low end cpu dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle gpus upto gtx3060 or rx6800  just go for it and say no to ryzen in this price for gaming 
352,2022-11-16,5,14500,India,12100F,this is one of the best cpu in budget if you only looking for gaming  for productivity it not worth buying then you should go for i5 12400f but for gaming and light cpu workload it work like butter smooth  i have teated some games in it   you can check it on my yt channel r tech studio 
353,2023-11-11,4,14500,India,12100F,performance is good
354,2023-08-24,3,14500,India,12100F,product is good but by looking at packaging anyone can judge that it is used  while checking warranty found that out of 3 year warranty  6 months is already passed 
355,2023-04-26,1,14500,India,12100F,cpu stock cooler fan got broken with 1 blade in box was creating noise and virbration in cpu but processor was working fine so thought to replace but if replace it i dont know what i am gonna get with broken cpu chip so i replaced stock cooler with deepcool air cooler now it s working fine please don t buy critical pc parts from amazon you may end up getting with broken parts worst packing
356,2023-06-20,1,14500,India,12100F,the processor is good   works fine  but the delivery was awful  one of the blades of the fan was broken  as i already had another dedicated cpu cooler  i didn t raise a return  i expected better from appario  apart from this the processor itself works fine 
357,2023-12-30,2,14500,Sweden,12100F,stood when i ordered it would come on january 5th since the day after i check and see that it is coming january 9
358,2024-01-27,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,very good  super recommend
359,2023-11-23,5,14500,Germany,12100F,incredible speed and also saves energy for office applications faster than a few years older core i7 processors  which at that time cost 700 euros also ideal for playing  all new games plays in full hd 
360,2024-04-08,5,14500,France,12100F,the intel core i3 12100f processor is ideal for midrange gaming due to its excellent performance price ratio with its four hearts and eight threads  it offers good treatment power to perform modern games without problem in addition  its high basic frequency and its ddr4 memory management up to 3200 mhz contribute to fluid performance in most games by combining this processor with a mid  range graphics card  you can get a very satisfactory gaming experience without having to spend a fortune on the equipment 
361,2023-02-02,5,14500,Australia,12100F,works great out of the box  stock cooler is much better than previous generations  overall value is still the best in 2023
362,2022-03-16,5,14500,Mexico,12100F,pull the processor very well
363,2024-04-26,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,the seller is to be congratulated i loved
364,2024-03-26,5,14500,Italy,12100F,the intel core i3 12100f processor is an interesting choice for those looking for solid performance without spending too much here are some details on the cpu  performance  the core i3 12100f is a quad core chip that can manage games if combined with a dedicated gpu it is more suitable for activities such as surfing on the internet  work  study and video calls despite being an economic solution  it offers reliable performance energy efficiency  this processor is designed to offer a good balance between power and energy consumption even raising the limits  you will see modest but remarkable improvements in performance  without compromising energy efficiency affordable price  with a cost of about 100 110 euros  the i3 12100f represents a convenient option for those who want to play in full hdwithout exhausting the budget in summary  if you are looking for an economic but capable processor  the intel core i3 12100f could be the right choice 
365,2023-10-01,5,14500,Spain,12100F,it goes like a shot  you can play the maximum resolution with the right graph without bottlenecks i have gone from an i5 of seventh generation and the difference is abysmal 
366,2024-04-09,5,14500,France,12100F,super processor for both gaming and the rest coupled with an rx 6750xt it s at the top all the games runs thoroughly it has a super rate and does not heat too much with a good ventirad buy apart possibility of the oc in bclk but not attempted i am already very satisfied 
367,2022-05-13,5,14500,Germany,12100F,this processor offers excellent gaming performance for very little money   the 12100f even has a higher singlet thread power than an amd ryzen 3700x  and this is brutally good in view of the low price  see screenshot    which is paired with a rtx 3050 or 6500 xthas a top budget gaming system for the narrow thaler with a lot of power for 1080p gaming i can only advise  access as long as it is still cheap 
368,2024-04-26,5,14500,the United Kingdom,12100F,it s fantastic for its price range for a beginner build and how it performs well for a budget cpu 
369,2024-05-31,5,14500,Germany,12100F,runs stable until now 
370,2023-10-11,5,14500,the United Kingdom,12100F,they perform better than even the 10th gen i9  it’s absurd how well the current i3s perform when compared to high end chips from even two years ago 
371,2024-05-05,5,14500,Italy,12100F,i came across the intel core i3 12100f processor and i was pleasantly surprised by his power and versatility first of all  i must underline the fluidity of the performance thanks to its modern architecture and the four physical cores  the i3 12100f manages all daily activities without problems  from web navigation sessions to the most demanding game sessions i noticed a marked improvement in performance compared to my old processor  especially in multthreading applications one of the things i appreciated most was reliability the i3 12100f proved to be stable even under intense workloads  without overheating and without compromising performance this gave me the tranquility necessary to focus on my work without having to worry about sudden slowdowns or system crashes  i must also mention its energy efficiency 
372,2024-01-14,5,14500,France,12100F,this processor offers an incredible price   performance ratio it is as powerful as my old 11700kf in simple heart  and 20  slower only in multi coeurs i obtained 2236 10151 before  sc mc  and now 2231 8153 on geekbench 6  i was very surprised  in use i have hardly seen the difference by going from 11700kf z590 to 12100f z790  except for heavy multi field work at this price it is really impressive 
373,2022-04-03,5,14500,Spain,12100F,being i3  it is mea to other previous generations due to its high cpi  and in games it shows yield as a 10400  in games that ask for a lot of cpi  is above this it has a low price for the performance it has but it has something bad  the plates are faces to the most shit  anyway  i recommend it the truth if intel lower the price of the plates  they petize it 
374,2023-08-16,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,come processor and fan  excellent cost benefit
375,2024-04-08,5,14500,Germany,12100F,holds what is described
376,2023-05-28,5,14500,the United Kingdom,12100F,great cpu for the price 
377,2022-07-25,5,14500,Spain,12100F,it is going well for the price you have
378,2024-01-15,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,find a supplier with short delivery time  very good 
379,2024-03-12,5,14500,France,12100F,mtn a little old  but well for debuting system
380,2024-04-11,5,14500,Italy,12100F,intel has always offered high quality products and this i3 is a further demonstration he does his work very well excellent quality price ratio in the package there is the dissatator with fan and the  core i3  sticker as with all intel  f  processors  need to be accompanied by a dedicated video card 
381,2022-10-06,5,14500,France,12100F,this 12th generation of intel processors is definitely excellent for 20 years  i had only bought amd  but reading many tests that had highlighted the qualities of the 12100f  i therefore decided to take the plunge at the start  i wanted a processor that is both powerful enough in the games  and which does not heat  and therefore that does not consume  already because it was intended to be placed in an htpc  having a little complicated airflow in essence  and then because i wanted to optimize the performance energy ratio i think it s mission accomplished reading movies  or while listening to music  the intel processor and the graphics card  gtx 1660 ti  do not each exceed 35 ° c  and climb respectively at 47 ° c and 62 ° c during the game sessions i specify that the 12100f is cooled by a low profile noctua nhl 12s ventirad  supported by an arctic p12 fan  and is fixed in the socket by an adjustment frame  supposed to avoid deformations of the processor surface  of thermalright brand in terms of power  this processor can be associated with any graphics card without limiting the potential of the latter  except perhaps those above the very powerful amd rx 6900 xt and rtx 3080 ti on the other hand  the intel will fish a little without being ridiculous know that she has as much responding as a top of the range of 4 years ago to summarize  with regard to the price  the 12100f is the best for a computer intended for versatile and economical use 
382,2024-03-10,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,bom
383,2022-02-03,5,14500,Germany,12100F,if the 4 kernels are enough   the hyperthreading  it is faster than a 6 penultimate generation coreer storage support is great and economical it is on top of that good 4 core  price a little high at the beginning  but that settles in semit  ligament cooler is absolutely sufficient and not heard everything fine
384,2022-09-12,4,14500,Italy,12100F,i like how the hearts of this processor beat  tested on several titles really keeps step in a shipped and elegant way as the vs i5 gen 10 and 11 videos show  it is not bad for the small in intel house  at the right price  whichthese days it is rare to find  it is recommended 
385,2022-04-12,4,14500,Spain,12100F,this 12th intel generation with alder lake works very well  i have mounted it with the asus b660 prime motherboard with ballistix and geforce 1050 memories  thinking of updating it then to 3060   and i have to say that it goes like a shot  fast loadingand consume little against  it brings a very poor cooling system  cpu fan cooler  that i do not recommend  it sounds a lot and under load does not keep the processor less than 69 degrees celsius of temperature  and it is not worth the paper   i solved it with acooler cooler master hyper h411r that fits perfect in lga 1700 
386,2023-08-25,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,the best cost effectiveness
387,2024-06-07,4,14500,France,12100F,good product for gaming but i should have turned to his big brother the i5 12400f which is very close to the price level     
388,2024-06-17,2,14500,Spain,12100F,the box was broken through the corners and in bad conditions  i understand that it is from the cast company  but the product was fragile 
389,2022-03-03,3,14500,the United Kingdom,12100F,as per the title  intel s 12th gen lower tier stock cooler is pants  don t waste your time installing it  temps are high and it s constantly spinning up sounding like a light aircraft  additionally if you are uk based and you buy from  amazon global  and need to return it for any reason  be prepared to have to pay the postage yourself and get reimbursed later  i think this is our fault  brexit  but either way it s a massive faff
390,2023-09-24,4,14500,Germany,12100F,the only thing i didn t like is shipping the packaging was open  dented  damaged but the cpu is great and nothing happened to the cooler 
391,2022-08-15,5,14500,Italy,12100F,a truly excellent cpu if obviously you are looking for an entrylevel product from the reviews it has performances from a upper range of a few years ago  the cpu has 4 cores with ht so it manages 8th i bought it for a second pc in a micro atx case with a single rear 92mm in extraction as performance and reactivity  the cpu is really not bad navigation  reproduction i did some cpuz  like beans and it goes a little more than my r5 1600 in multi  6c 12t  and much more in st basically if you are looking for a cpu for navigation use  reproduction  light productivity  gaming  perhaps retrogaming on dx11 games  is the right product if you do gaming on modern games  dx12  and with the goal of refresh supported  even minimal  then better a 12400 or higher  speaking of intel  i did tests with intelburntest and the cpu remains at 4 089ghz on all cores with 75 ° t in winter and 82 ° in july i state that i use the stock i said i only changed the thermal paste  arctic mx4  the fan tends to turn a little fast to keep the t under control  however it is not very noisy on the contrary let s say that in my opinion i said is a little at the limit but it keeps the cpu at bay if it were an i5  six cores  i would recommend an aftermarket solution 
392,2022-06-20,4,14500,Spain,12100F,great for all daily tasks and even for more intensive use like games the fan included could be quieter 
393,2023-08-06,5,14500,Germany,12100F,pretty cool in terms of temperature  powerful due to new architecture and reliable  works more than a month in pair with an rtx 2060  no problems occurred during this time  i truly recommend 
394,2023-11-11,5,14500,France,12100F,the packaging to make by amazon leaves something to be desired for product of this type however  the product works perfectly the performance is there the ventirad provided is enough to cool it i am not going up to more than 60 ° very good processor for gaming
395,2022-11-28,5,14500,Germany,12100F,so i m a streamer and honest  i had actually got a better cpu  but it was much better here  but why this cpu with the right graphics card is absolutely done by and for this price  just wow that is great
396,2024-01-18,5,14500,Italy,12100F,great entry level processor  little energy but still good performance
397,2023-10-02,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,as expected 
398,2024-02-06,5,14500,France,12100F,perfect product to start a setup
399,2024-05-19,4,14500,France,12100F,good
400,2024-04-29,5,14500,France,12100F,in line with comments 4 and more no complaints i recommend 
401,2024-03-07,5,14500,Italy,12100F,this baby monster is crazy for the cost     very little and chips to be afraid i use it in any area  also games  never to be signs of failure in this price range there is no better cpu  i recommend it 
402,2024-03-14,5,14500,Italy,12100F,excellent in points of view  a perfect entry level for the world of gaming after a year of use did not give me any problem
403,2024-02-08,5,14500,France,12100F,hello the intel i3 microprocessor works very well but it is not compatible with the motherboard azus z790 p this is the only reason for the return actually it has been the subject of a return but i am already shipped to you firstprocessor with the fan reimbursement of this will allow me to buy a compatible processor thank you 
404,2023-06-12,4,14500,France,12100F,excellent processor which is greater than an i7 of generation 8  effective in play  but less efficient on certain professional software  in particular the software dedicated to rendering however  the venti rad proposed in series is limited climb to over 3000 rpm at full load which causes a lot of noise the processor reaches 80 degrees in the stress test phase  which is correct  but not optimum  there are 20 degrees of margin before the safety stop  however even the processor rarely reaches 60   investing in a fan rad will not be a luxury in case you still use the serial fan  remember to take thermal dough intel is quite stingy and the little that is placed on the base of the fan rad is largely insufficient 
405,2024-03-01,5,14500,France,12100F,very good cpu
406,2023-11-30,4,14500,Italy,12100F,very good processor  for 30 euros more honestly i would have taken i5 as it is slightly better in gaming this does not mean that it is not suitable for playing because i am still very well
407,2024-02-07,5,14500,France,12100F,for a hundred euros probably one of the best value for money at present 
408,2024-01-22,5,14500,France,12100F,good
409,2023-10-18,5,14500,France,12100F,i took this cpu after seeing the tests that are really impressive for this range taken to make a small roblox style game config for a child  it goes comfortable and i know that she will be able to keep it a few more years 
410,2024-06-08,1,14500,France,12100F,i checked the compatibility  changed motherboard  then ram  then power not believing that it can come from the proc    and yet    it seems that this is the case  i have never seen that in 20 years ofpc montage    but hey    there is a start to everything  too bad it falls on me  s
411,2024-01-04,5,14500,Italy,12100F,ecepccial speed
412,2023-08-19,4,14500,France,12100F,not enough specialist to comment
413,2022-10-16,5,14500,Italy,12100F,what to say best buy a small missile at a zero price this processor is suitable for build fhd and 1440p with a combination of a dedicated dedicated gpu i use it every day  it works very well tested with my brother s pc this i3 tears some fps more compared to the 5600x on my brother s pc  same gpu and ram  does not heat anything and consumes very little so they are enough not exaggerated power supplies  and enormous dissatator 4 physical and 4 virtual cores excellent for everything 100  recommended for build from 700 1000 €
414,2022-06-24,3,14500,France,12100F,the processor does not even worry  apart from the fact that its memoirs controller is limited to ram 3200 max but the ventirad is far too light for the game  occt increases the temperature to 82 degrees in just 1min30  with 25 ambient degree  i stopped the test did not want to take it to a thermal throttling edit  i still take away a star for the ventirad 24 degree ambient  on the games  it flirts with the 80 degrees during the full loads and the unbearable noise of the fan which  in play  is direct very high in the towers to  go down   painfully  the temperature i order a real ventirad      i finally took a cooler master  day and night   otherwise there is the snowman at 20 25th but no kit 1700 available on amazon it seems 
415,2022-10-24,3,14500,France,12100F,it clearly does the job for the small and average config personally i put it with a 2060 i have better performance than the i5 10400f we clearly see an improvement compared to the old gen when it is an i3 but be careful ifyou use the ventirad supplied with change the thermal paste on the processor my processor mounted at 95 degrees in play with their thermal paste which was beforehand a disaster i had to buy the thermal paste so that it is stabilized at 60 i do not knowif i was unlucky with the dough but monitor your temperature to check in case
416,2023-08-25,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,product delivered quickly by post  good salesperson  i recommend 
417,2022-07-08,5,14500,France,12100F,excellent processor for limited budget gaming very underestimated  the i3 12100 is the small  gti  of the processors it is the best quality price ratio for entry  level excellent consumption heating perf ratio the performances are the same as its counterparts in i5 i7 and r5 r7 when cut with a mid  range gpu she has nothing to envy  unless you have a hundred euros to put more on an i5 12400 or an r5 5600
418,2022-09-02,5,14500,Italy,12100F,surprising i3  little shopping and lots of yield i assembled a pc from scratch starting from him  a big leap forward by my old phenom ii x4 many complain that it is an i3  future bottleneck and blah blah blah if you want to spend more  do it  but this safely holds every current title  it costs little and is new exceptional quality price ratio 
419,2022-10-02,5,14500,Italy,12100F,in this historical period where the prices went to the stars  those who want to play computers without pretensions have very few options this processor is a good candidate unfortunately  if you move on to an average high  level video or streaming  it begins to slow down  but after all it is still an i3  designed for home use 
420,2023-07-29,5,14500,France,12100F,very good processor do not heat and fast 
421,2023-03-03,5,14500,France,12100F,mounted on cm msi mag mortar max b660m      overclocking more than 5ghz     perf price level there is no better i specify that it is a processor intended for gaming
422,2022-07-08,5,14500,France,12100F,the best gaming processor for small budget  a monster of power for barely € 100  if you plan to set up a machine for cheap it is the must have  beyond an rx 6600 xt this cpu will restrict your graphics cardin 1080p but with higher resolution will still be extremely effective compared to the upper range processor 
423,2023-01-05,5,14500,Italy,12100F,a nice processor  mounted on an msi pro h610m b ddr4 goes great  even if i expected better than its predecessor i3 10100f  even all everything is ok  even delivery 
424,2023-03-16,5,14500,France,12100F,very good processor to update a z690 at a lower cost otherwise it is completely obsolete 
425,2022-12-13,5,14500,Germany,12100F,i bought the cpu for an office pc absolutely fine for this purpose 
426,2022-04-11,5,14500,France,12100F,i bought this cpu to renew my office pc  with a multimedia vocation and gender diablo or starcraft games well     what was not my surprise when i saw that it was as fast in games as the 3700x of my piloting simulator a real rocket for a ridiculous price 
427,2022-06-27,5,14500,Italy,12100F,the cheapest processor of 2022  but which behaves very well in the game  i associated it with a rtx 3060 ti and i cannot complain    the 240 fps for 240hz monitors exceeds them and keeps them excellently 
428,2022-11-19,5,14500,France,12100F,buyed for my brother it is very happy with it  specially use for gaming  they ring  overwatch  dying light 2      i recommend the ventirad is pretty too 
429,2023-04-30,5,14500,Italy,12100F,bella cpu
430,2022-11-16,5,14500,Germany,12100F,as an upgrade from one i5 4th generation works perfectly 
431,2022-07-18,5,14500,France,12100F,small ultra  gifted processor that allows you to play or work without ever being in default for the price do not hesitate  note that the next generation of intel processor will use the same lga 1700 socket
432,2022-07-16,5,14500,France,12100F,so you could say that an i3 is bof  but it really has a hell of a power turned up games like ciberpunk with an rx6600 on 60fps 1080p i3 on ​​paper but the power of an i5 recommends so small budget
433,2022-10-01,5,14500,Germany,12100F,runs like a beast   haven’t had any noticeable issues so far 
434,2023-04-22,3,14500,France,12100F,but nothing is broken by a happy coincidence
435,2023-04-20,3,14500,France,12100F,pepper delivery  thermalpast and poor quality cooler 
436,2022-08-28,5,14500,France,12100F,this little processor is really surprising for its price  performance is there ideal for an entry  level gaming configuration i recommend this product and the seller 
437,2022-02-19,3,14500,France,12100F,good quality price product  fairly easy to install but lacks information about the different rams  on frequencies you have to look in depth on intel sites and on the internet to conclude that fairly common rams are not compatible and that xmp technology is not well supported by the processor because it is  no k  be careful to choose the right ram accordingly
438,2022-08-06,5,14500,Germany,12100F,mega cpu  in games with rtx3080 faster than a 10900 non k 
439,2022-08-27,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,i received quickly all right with the product new cooler came  and application of thermal paste in the sink apparently everything ok i haven t tested it yet i m waiting for other pieces i recommend 
440,2023-10-10,5,28500,India,12400,box contents  intel core i5 12400 processor chip and cpu fan cooler  this processor is good for daily routine tasks but for heavy load usage and gaming go for the intel core i5 13400 or 13500 processor 
441,2024-03-26,5,28500,India,12400,i am build my first pc this processor
442,2023-07-17,5,28500,India,12400,good and efficient 👍
443,2024-01-15,4,28500,India,12400,getting optimal speed without any overheating issue
444,2024-01-27,5,28500,India,12400,i received this product without any defects
445,2023-10-25,5,28500,India,12400,super
446,2023-03-07,5,28500,India,12400,ideal for regular work   i do some basic photo and video editing too  without any problems   gamers   high end users should go for higher specs if the intention is higher usage 
447,2022-12-26,5,28500,India,12400,very powerfull processor in this range u dont need saparate graphic card if you are on low end pc games   u have a option for gaming untill u use graphic card     pavking is original and recieved unused favtory packed processor    
448,2022-05-03,5,28500,India,12400,performance is almost as good as 5600x and also consume less power than 5600x in gaming   stock cooler provided is not good enough though  see if it can keep good temperature for you else get good air cooler 
449,2024-06-19,5,28500,Japan,12400,no problem j
450,2022-04-28,5,28500,Singapore,12400,i was initially only bought this due to it being the most affordable mid range cpu at 290 sgd for my new build  and was also considering similarly priced amd ryzen 5600x  but settled on this ultimately  i do not regret this at all  the performance is amazing and can run cpu intensive games well along with my 3060ti  the stock cooler provided is also amazing and simple to install  but would have preferred if it came with metal mounting screws instead of cheap feeling plastic push pins   the price is well below other retail shops in singapore including sim lim square  although it is shipped from overseas  it is genuine and the packaging arrived sealed and undamaged  the shipping time also took less than a week   the only problem was that motherboards with lga 1700 sockets  that supports 12gen intel processors  are currently much more expensive than lga 1200 or amd counterparts  so i had to settle with a non ideal matx motherboard to stay within my budget 
451,2023-01-15,5,28500,Mexico,12400,it is a very complete cpu  i am doing well with my rtx 3080 of 10gb  perfect for high  performance games and emulators  i love after just over 6 months of use  i have not had problems with any game or activity  it is perfect combinationalso with a pcie 4 gen ssd  the machine flies it has a good price ratio  it is also ready for update for ddr5 memories while you wait for you to lower if you can use ddr4 with a compatible and cheaper motherboard 
452,2022-09-30,1,28500,Germany,12400,unfortunately  the product packaging was open and glued back  which i felt suspicious and in fact only the fan  but not the processor was included 😕😕
453,2023-12-10,5,28500,Canada,12400,the best value price ratio for my needs  fast  stable  compatible  good power consumption 
454,2024-05-01,5,28500,Canada,12400,worked well so far during my 4months of ownership  it still kinda sad that a similar cpu from 2018 is just 25 40  slower  which for most people is barely noticeable  that is 5y of advancement 
455,2022-06-13,5,28500,Singapore,12400,intel i5 12400 maybe the best choice for gaming  no need efficient cores  the 6 performance cores with hyper thread are powerful enough 
456,2024-03-13,5,28500,the United States,12400,so far it has been a good performance in gaming and productivity
457,2024-02-06,5,28500,Japan,12400,it may be because it is not a game console  but the startup time is within 30 seconds i was surprised it is a speed that does not feel any problem at all 
458,2023-02-06,5,28500,Mexico,12400,it is a processor which is very good for video games and supports very balanced the graphs editions 30 of nvidia  and left over in the 20  which is the self i have an edition 20  the performance is very good and its this generation was very good compared to the previous
459,2022-02-26,5,28500,the United States,12400,upgraded a 2600k pc with this cpu  b660 board and 32gb of 3600mhz ram  it feels incredibly snappy now  with gpus now costing your firstborn child  it s nice that this upgrade boosted an aging gtx970 fps by 5 15     2560x1080  gaming is also much smoother as low fps spikes are effectively non existent now   the included heatsink and fan is actually not as terrible as i was anticipating  it doesn t get all that loud and it looks halfway decent  it seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing  70 ambient  and mid 60s during actual gaming  i will replace it eventually but i m not that concerned as it works fine  i did wipe off the pre pasted thermal grease and added some mx 4 instead   the internal hd 730 is nice to have as a backup  anyone who doesn t need that should seek out the  12400f  model as it s the exact same chip with no internal gpu  and it should be  15  25 cheaper   as of this posting  it s hard to beat the value of this cpu  12400f 12400  for gaming 
460,2024-05-14,5,28500,Canada,12400,great cpu for the price for a diy nas 
461,2022-04-28,5,28500,Mexico,12400,it helped me to install it in my new motherboard asus tuf gaming b660m wifi d4 and it works wonderfully  i had trouble installing the dissipator with an integrated fan since it cost me work to make the insurance enter well in the slots of the motherboard but in the endhe entered well  just to consider it when installing the dissipator  you have to put a lot of strength until they click the insurance 
462,2023-04-07,5,28500,Japan,12400,geforce rtx2060 has enough performance to avoid becoming a cpu neck  4th generation i7 overclocked lock the video bench has just risen about 5    measurement error range   so the mother was no problem i made it myself in a hurry  so i made it a kore  but the fans of the cooler attached to the performance were noisy and i immediately replaced it  4th generation quiet cooler was not processed as the previous information  the 13th generation increased the number of core  but only a few thousand yen up multi  mulch  but also the single core performance was higher than the price  but the pc was broken since the performance improvement between 11th generation and 12th generation is amazing  the stagnation from 4 to 9 generations is noticeable 
463,2023-11-06,5,28500,the United States,12400,this cpu matched with an amd or nvidia card is powerful for running gaming and even editing or working online  i highly recommend this cpu for a mid high end gpu to match with
464,2024-03-24,5,28500,Canada,12400,going from i7 3770 to i5 12400 is a big improvement even with out an nvme its faster than what i had with gaming an google with tabs open tho i do want the 14 core i5 13th gen but i am impressed with what i have for the time being  d
465,2022-06-05,5,28500,Mexico,12400,something that made me strange is that the product came open  i do not know if it is for revision  probation and everything works the truth content with performance the dissipator that has included is sufficient to keep it at a good temperature  but i think it is necessaryto a future change it for something better
466,2022-10-31,5,28500,Japan,12400,cospa is good because the price is used in the game and the price is cheap if you connect a monitor cable to the mother side and use it without inserting a cable into the grab  you can usually switch to onbo  and at a high load  and it can be saved 
467,2023-11-18,4,28500,Canada,12400,this is pretty decent speed it is as fast or faster than my i7 11700 that runs windows server  find the best price  use non economy mother board  that has bitten me in the past 
468,2024-06-07,5,28500,the United States,12400,it is an excellent intel manufacturing product generation 
469,2024-01-12,4,28500,Japan,12400,it is working without any problems 
470,2022-04-21,5,28500,Mexico,12400,perfect value for money 
471,2022-08-14,5,28500,Mexico,12400,the very protected box came very well in perfect condition came with its heat dissipator running correctly very good product
472,2024-04-05,5,28500,the United States,12400,he arrived at the time indicated by amazon and the national currier in my country  ecuador the processor came in perfect condition without problems or damage the processor s cooler is very beautiful and seems to be much better than my old i5 4460 i already feel the difference just being using it a couple of days i also have this processor with 16gb in ram ddr4 at 3600mhz 1 ssd msi spatium 1tb  which i also bought at amazon   mainboard asus tuf gaming b76m plus wifi d4  gpu rx580sp 8gb  which i bought at the chinese store  you know what i mean   i will be testing the processor and i will comment on its performance 
473,2022-06-12,5,28500,Japan,12400,it may be very fast this is enough because i don t play much 
474,2022-09-04,5,28500,Canada,12400,i used this processor for my pc build and didn t have any issues  the thermal paste is already applied to the cpu fan  do don t stick you hand in it like i did 
475,2024-05-13,5,28500,the United States,12400,you can practically with all games combined with a good graph like a 4070 or an rx 7700  for the price there is nothing that exceeds it
476,2023-06-05,1,28500,Mexico,12400,be careful to those who ask for 2 hand  in my case i did not expect a beautiful box or anything but that at least had the processor
477,2023-02-01,3,28500,Japan,12400,it is cheap on the outlet and purchased it works without any problems 
478,2024-04-24,4,28500,the United States,12400,the cpu throttles for no reason during gameplay causing multiple crashes  i would not recommend this for gamming 
479,2023-08-30,5,28500,Canada,12400,fast cpu
480,2024-04-06,5,28500,the United States,12400,was running a little to hot with stock cooler  so i added a ak400 digital air cooler  the difference is20c cooler at idle and gaming  huge difference  i thought it was my gpu causing  nope the cpu was running hot  now 31c at idle and 50 or under during most games
481,2024-04-11,5,28500,the United States,12400,the seller includes thermal and dissipator pasta the processor works perfectly 
482,2024-02-18,4,28500,the United States,12400,the default cooler can’t maintain a reasonable temp  and i found it nearly impossible to install  expect to use a real cooler 
483,2024-03-06,5,28500,the United States,12400,one of the best range processors market average
484,2024-02-26,5,28500,the United States,12400,excellent product status  i have not tried it  but it looks very good
485,2024-01-18,5,28500,the United States,12400,my team had a resounding change with this processor in addition to having a cost benefit bus
486,2024-02-05,5,28500,the United States,12400,perfect 💯👌
487,2023-09-14,5,28500,the United States,12400,the i5 12400 is at a nice spot on the value performance curve for a homelabber  anything lower and you only get four cores  anything higher and you have to deal with the p core e core dichotomy  the included heatsink fan combo isn t much to look at but it gets the job done 
488,2024-01-08,5,28500,Canada,12400,i like it little cpu  6 cores and better than ryzen 5 3600
489,2023-12-13,5,28500,the United States,12400,good performance and quality price
490,2023-05-13,5,28500,the United States,12400,i wasn t expecting much out of this cpu but it runs 3d cad software better than my old i7 6700k and completely blows it out of the water with rendering and tool path generation  for the price it s dang near perfect  it s about 20  slower at generating tool paths than an i5 12600k but way faster than the previous generation cpus  it s definitely a jump forward from the i5 11400 and about equivalent of an i5 11600k or a 10th gen i7
491,2023-10-15,5,28500,the United States,12400,this processor works amazingly fast  hell so far i am able to run armored core 6  and vr games just great 
492,2023-12-01,5,28500,the United States,12400,very good processor 
493,2022-12-07,5,28500,the United States,12400,you get more cores than an i3 based cpu  if you want to save a lot  you could go with a 12100f  but i think you get a lot of value with this cpu  you get the faster pcie lanes and more of them compared to the 10th and 11th gen cpus  and you can use a single fan low profile heatsink and fan with this and get around 75c temperatures during cpu stress tests  when the 13400 comes out though  this might not be worth it depending on the price it comes out with  but for now you get a great value and great performance 
494,2023-06-10,5,28500,the United States,12400,the processor arrived well it worked well and so far without problems 2 months have passed and it works well for games for now it is well running with a 3070  i know there is more power in a 12600kf  but for the moment this 12400 is wonderful it also includes integrated graphics 
495,2022-02-20,5,28500,the United States,12400,great 6 core chip for just about everything  very good gaming performance  will not bottleneck your gpu  even if you have a 3080 3070 ti  or a 6800  6800xt this cpu will deliver great performance  i have bought 2 so far and i even paired them with a budget asrock b660 motherboard and still performed at highest speeds with 135w pl2  this cpu will definitely last a good 5 years since it has great ipc performance and is compatible with ddr5 ram  all this for approx  180 220 is a bargain  if you don t need to overclock or don t want to spend a great deal of money this is the cpu for you  will provide much better performance per dollar on a long term basis than the 12100 12300 4 cores cpus 
496,2023-09-24,5,28500,the United States,12400,expected quality  do not heat up much  easy to install and with good speed  it is recommended
497,2023-07-15,5,28500,the United States,12400,using it for a computer at church that is running propresenter 7  and it seems to be handling it fine  also using it with a xfx radeon rx 6600 gpu  and corsair ddr5 5600 32gb 
498,2023-01-16,5,28500,the United States,12400,this cpu wasn t my first choice  was aiming for the f version but for the time being i needed a cpu to finish my rig and bought this one  so far it s been almost 4 months and everything is working perfectly  paired it with 32gb ram from corsair and an asus tuf gaming b660 plus wifi d4  not using the stock cooler but temps stay on the low 40s and never reaches more than 60 degrees  overall a good choice for a mid tier build 
499,2023-09-19,5,28500,the United States,12400,what can i say  the really valuable  decent  and low budget pc core 
500,2023-08-31,5,28500,the United States,12400,all in perfect condition  very well packed and for now it works great
501,2023-02-24,5,28500,the United States,12400,if you re looking to save money but also want an extremely competent and reliable processor in 2023  the 12400 is a safe pick  i run this with a rx 6600 xt and i can stream a 1080p 60fps game in high ultra settings  watch streams on the side and download a game on steam at the same time with no cpu bottleneck  need i say more 
502,2023-05-05,4,28500,the United States,12400,one of the best game processors in 2023 in quality price 
503,2023-03-15,4,28500,the United States,12400,he arrived on time but did not bring me the dissipator with which the processor cooled i can not do tests to see if everything is fine
504,2023-09-17,5,28500,the United States,12400,works great paired with my 3060 
505,2023-04-16,5,28500,the United States,12400,my build uses an msi b760 ddr4 mobo and kingston fury 3200 ram and a wd sn770 ssd  it s been running flawlessly from first power up til today  roughly 3 weeks  the 12400 is fast enough and the price was good 
506,2023-05-28,5,28500,the United States,12400,i acquired it at a low second price and the processor goes perfect it is very fast  handles low temperatures and for gaming and heavy applications is left over highly recommended
507,2022-12-24,4,28500,the United States,12400,don t hesitate one second before replacing with a vertical cooler  a 120 mm model  selling for  39  was easier to install  lowered idle temps from 50 to 25 deg c  and is silent  what more can be said 
508,2023-07-27,5,28500,the United States,12400,i have it on a pc to play and it works with all the wonder programs
509,2023-05-01,4,28500,Canada,12400,building a gaming pc  everything is just fine except for the packaging 
510,2023-07-18,5,28500,the United States,12400,runs a media server on rog strix 790 e board  plenty of juice for multiple streams 
511,2023-08-31,5,28500,the United States,12400,very good product for my needs
512,2022-05-16,5,28500,the United States,12400,i bought this processor in approximately   590 000 cop and has been very good in general  the performance is consistent with what you pay i went for the integrated gpu version since the price difference was very little compared to the i5 12400f the stock dissipator is sufficient in most cases  aesthetically more attractive compared to previous generations  however  i would recommend changing it for another dissipator  good options are found from 25usd to 30usd   to avoid high temperature peaks 
513,2022-09-20,5,28500,the United States,12400,for games it gives better performance than the current ryzen 5000 processors and it is more economical to build an intel pc with generation 12 than a pc with ryzen generation 5000  and thus i summarize a decent motherboard lga 1700 as the b660m costs one   109 and if you want to buy an am4 plate for ryzen 5000 that is pciex 4 0 you must spend minimum more than   120 
514,2023-03-29,4,28500,the United States,12400,assisted in solving the problems i had 
515,2023-08-03,3,28500,Canada,12400,this is a decent value 12th gen cpu  but keep in mind when intel said they would allow ecc on all 12th gen parts on a w680 board they specifically exclude the 12400  you have to go to something like a 12100 or 12500 for that functionality 
516,2023-04-11,3,28500,Canada,12400,fast shipping as usual  the whole package seems fine but seems opened before since there were hair dust on the paste  i had to clean off the stock paste  lucky me i had a thermal paste on hand and really needed to use it or i would have returned it  very disappointed on a 250  purchase on a cpu  not gonna buy something important again 
517,2023-01-14,4,28500,the United States,12400,had for about a week now  and its a massive upgrade over my last processor  good value for budget 
518,2022-02-22,5,28500,the United States,12400,tested crusader kings 3 for 50 years at max speed  not a stutter  stock cooler kept things nice and operable at 69 70c even by the end of the stress test  however  i did buy extra thermal paste and applied about 1ml across the full surface of the cpu chip itself  as others had recommended   value seems good  especially when you consider the fan should be able to keep up for most purposes 
519,2023-04-20,5,28500,the United States,12400,it is incredible the price and compatibility with last range of this processor in addition to the speed that manages
520,2023-03-02,5,28500,the United States,12400,thanks to allah for this gift  i am very happy of this processor the processor is working perfectly thermal paste is already applied at the bottom of the condenser thank you amazon and thank you intel 
521,2022-10-22,4,28500,Canada,12400,hasn’t let me down so far  and is very easy to work with   it doesn’t run very hot  so you can easily get away with running on the stock cooler
522,2023-05-04,5,28500,the United States,12400,it comes with a dissipator everything works wonders  the dissipator is better than those of previous generation 
523,2022-10-09,5,28500,the United States,12400,play video i have this core and 5 12 generation with the rtx 3060 12gb graphics card edit everything in 4k to the maximum resolution with rendering videos that last 10 minutes and are delayed 10 minutes 
524,2022-11-06,5,28500,the United States,12400,i love it  it s a great addition to my pc  i knew what i was getting too so i knew you cant over clock it  but it runs great and the stock cpu cooler is solid  i suggest upgrading obviously   but it s exactly what i wanted 
525,2022-09-02,5,28500,the United States,12400,this cpu is a price to performance king for intel  comparable with lga1700 socket types and supports both ddr4 and ddr5  i meant to get this as a budget cpu for my girlfriends first build but it’s cheaper and on par for performance with my i710700k  very satisfied
526,2023-06-03,5,28500,the United States,12400,it works without problems  all good 
527,2023-03-18,5,28500,the United States,12400,got it for the wife  just uses it for web browsing and emails lol  its enough for her 
528,2022-10-20,5,28500,the United States,12400,the processor arrived in a very well  packed coffee box and the seller adds a much complainant than the factory very grateful for the great warm of the processor and the discupator it came very well packed and on time 
529,2022-08-09,5,28500,the United States,12400,it is an excellent cpu  however it is advisable to look for a solution ends different from the one included since  during heavy work loads even if the fan maintained optimal temperatures  it makes a lot of noise and can become somewhat annoying 
530,2024-04-24,5,29999,India,12400F,the processor was very power efficient i develop android apps and web development and for this the processor was beast and i do some little gaming with rx580 which combination was superb with 5400mhz ddr5 memory 1 tb ssd      
531,2024-06-15,5,29999,India,12400F,this processor is great mid to high range budget builds  if your looking for a cpu for around 10k inr  this is the perfect choice  it has 6 cores and 12 threads which is quite powerful  for me  pairing it with rx 6600 gave me around 120 fps in almost all games while playing on high graphics  about the stock cooler  the stock cooler can definitely keep the heat away  i experienced less than 60° while gaming  although u can go for a better cooler if u prefer that  but the stock cooler will do its job  overall 9 5 10 product 
532,2024-02-18,4,29999,India,12400F,this will not work without graphic card  so be careful before ordering 
533,2024-05-14,5,29999,India,12400F,try to get it under 10k and check the rankings in details sections before buying anything
534,2024-03-24,5,29999,India,12400F,i upgrade from 9400f  the performance gain is a huge  i use cooler master hyper 212 with this and my cbinet have 3 intake 2 exhaust fan  temp never cross 60°c even when full load stress test  the efficiency of this processor is incredible runs below 1 2 volt  it never reach 1 2v even when doing multi core stress test  if you re building mid range pc for gaming purpose this is the cpu you should consider  at this price point there s nothing that can beat this processor 
535,2024-04-07,5,29999,India,12400F,best 👌 gaming and multitasking processor at the price of 12k for budget pc of of 80 k arround
536,2023-11-14,4,29999,India,12400F,this one has no graphics processing unit and hence if you use this without graphics card  the bios will not boot   other than that this is an excellent processor
537,2024-01-28,5,29999,India,12400F,it runs well for productivity tasks  6 cores cpu is minimum requirement for smooth running any large software 
538,2023-11-30,5,29999,India,12400F,got at the cheapest price of 10250rs in the sale  i was a bit worried about getting scammed since this processor was never sold for this low price  but guess i was in luck  the performance is just as good as expected 😄
539,2023-11-05,5,29999,India,12400F,i am used processor gigabyte motherboard working properly 2 5 gh speed 12 logical processor working properly
540,2023-10-17,5,29999,India,12400F,received in good condition  good packing and got it for only 11900 value for money beast  
541,2023-07-13,4,29999,India,12400F,after installing it  windows 11 is giving the following description of the processor   12th gen intel r  core tm  i5 12400f 2 50 ghz  it requires a graphics card 
542,2022-04-20,5,29999,India,12400F,got this product in good package 📦  i have paired this cpu with my rx 590 and 16 gb ram 3200 mhz   if you are looking for budget gaming  this is excellent   gaming benchmark  assassin s creed unity  80 fps high setting  apex legends  144  fps ultra settings pubg steam  110 fps  very high settings  the cpu temp goes to 67°c max during intensive gameplay for 5 6 hours  make sure to put heatsink correctly  stock cooler is enough   i am using msi h610m g motherboard  the stock cooler gives enough room for ram sticks  make sure to have psu of at least 500 watt 
543,2023-10-21,5,29999,India,12400F,good product
544,2023-07-05,5,29999,India,12400F,value for money

546,2024-03-03,1,29999,India,12400F,play video fan is not working faulty device  suggest not to buy this from here no support help me 😞  very disappointed
547,2022-09-08,5,29999,India,12400F,this is excellent budget gaming processor    value for money the stock cooler is waste   better get one external cooler from coolermaster or corsair or deepcool
548,2023-02-25,5,29999,India,12400F,good not open box
549,2024-01-31,1,29999,India,12400F,don’t buy  there’re selling used and defective product 
550,2022-12-21,5,29999,India,12400F,excellent for beginners and students
551,2022-09-11,5,29999,India,12400F,must buy for gamers
552,2024-01-23,5,29999,India,12400F,been using it since an year no problem at all can run any current aaa game can handle multi tasking mid to not very high level gaming with no problems if u have other good combination of components integrated
553,2022-07-25,3,29999,India,12400F,caution   price 18k is overprice now  please buy it under 15k only otherwise check some other applications sites for better price 
554,2022-04-03,4,29999,India,12400F,the cpu is overall great for everything  it’ll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming  if you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy  but the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler  first of all i would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn’t  and also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting  also the performance is not nice  many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so i took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95 degrees  and it was approx the same case while gaming  idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling  so be careful with the stock cooler  or i would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like india where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don’t have an ac in your room  aio is the choice 
555,2022-07-14,5,29999,India,12400F,best processor in this price range  best performance all together 
556,2022-10-10,5,29999,India,12400F,it is a good processor to build a low budget computer  in this processor  you have to install a separate graphic card  for the display  i would also say that installing a cooler or a liquid cooler is also very important because this processor heats up more 
557,2022-07-22,5,29999,India,12400F,got this product in good package 📦  i have paired this cpu with my rx 590 and 16 gb ram 3200 mhz   if you are looking for budget gaming  this is excellent   gaming benchmark  assassin s creed unity  80 fps high setting  apex legends  144  fps ultra settings pubg steam  110 fps  very high settings  the cpu temp goes to 67°c max during intensive gameplay for 5 6 hours  make sure to put heatsink correctly  stock cooler is enough   i am using msi h610m g motherboard  the stock cooler gives enough room for ram sticks  make sure to have psu of at least 500 watt 
558,2024-03-09,5,29999,Germany,12400F,i bought the processor for an h1 v2 from nzxt this runs without problems on an asus strix b760i with 2x ddr5 6000mhz cl30 we recommend 
559,2024-01-17,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,i ve owned more expensive cpus   up to amd ryzen 9 and intel 13900k  in most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages  most of the work i was doing offloaded everything to my gpu so having a beastly cpu was a waste   i ve downgraded to this cpu in my main desktop rig  it s great for productivity software  music and design work  as well as gaming  i have it paired with a rtx 4000 series card and haven t noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming   maybe 1 5 fps  in most games i max out the monitor s 144hz fps at 1440p   one different thing about this cpu over other intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores  with 12 threads   hyperthreading  and no low powered efficiency cores   they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power    the cpu is also very efficient and runs quite cool  mine is 26c when idle and 26 30 light tasks such as browsing the web  during gaming   the temps are usually in the mid 50s  benchmarking  such as cinebench and geekbench etc  reaches mid 60s  i am using a two fan deepcool as500 plus air cooler with three case 120mm fans   all in all   very happy with purchase and highly recommend

562,2024-04-17,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,great performance with cost benefit but there is a very important detail no gpu included in other words  your computer needs a video card to work  unlike other gpu processors included an important detail 
563,2024-03-16,5,29999,the Netherlands,12400F,due to my old i5 8400 a world of difference everything no longer charges delays anymore in combination with an rx 6600 as good as all games at 1080p on at least 75fps 
564,2024-04-17,5,29999,Poland,12400F,it works  low power consumption  thanks to 65tdp it does not heat for bardo  in combination with ml240l in the a4 h2o housing  the maximum temperature during stress test is   65c  normally when playing   58c
565,2023-08-25,5,29999,Australia,12400F,price  performance  gaming  this cpu is beyond amazing  and then you see the price and holy moly it is a powerhouse at an unbelievable price 
566,2023-12-07,5,29999,Spain,12400F,after a long time of use and several tests  i concluded my opinions by listing the various strengths and weaknesses of this processor  multinuk performance  with six nuclei and twelve subprocesses  it stands out in multiprocess tasks  as rendered video and 3d modeling  offering notableperformance for a mid  range processor balanced games  game performance is solid  which guarantees a stable frame rate in recent games effective thread management contributes to a better game experience fluid productivity  for daily productivity tasks  such as web navigation  document and multitasking processing  the processor offers a rapid and fluid experience energy consumption  thanks to the architecture of alder lake and advanced manufacturing processes  energy consumption is low  which contributes to greater efficiency detailed defects of the intel i5 12400f  lack of integrated graphics  the lack of an integrated graphic unit implies the need to buy a discrete graphics card  which increases the total cost  especially if the user does not yet have one overclocking limitations  for those interested in overclocking  it is possible that the processor does not offer the same capacities as the  k  variants of the same family thermal dissipation  in intensive workloads  the processor can generate heat  being necessary an adequate cooling system to avoid overheating in general  the intel i5 12400f represents a balanced option  which offers an excellent commitment between performance  price and energy efficiency its performance varies according to use  but in general it is a reliable processor for a variety of tasks 
567,2024-04-30,5,29999,Germany,12400F,i just bought this 12400f because amazon had it for a day for € 105     then i exchanged my 12100f and it was worth it in games it is not to be noticed  but current tietel bring more fps but above all the game runs a little  smooth  so somehow more fluid  the min fps are higher in office usunegn it doesn t matter whether 4 8 or 6 12 core  it is not noticeable  but when i change an mkv file to avi  it saves about 40  time with the arcitc freezer esport duo  he does not run over 35c in the office  not over 60c in games and not over 75c when changing the file  100  leakage   what more i want  and since i can still get my old 12100f away well  is wellthe new so cheaper    
568,2024-02-08,5,29999,France,12400F,i am not a pro configurations and my knowledge is basics i had to replace an old i7 7700k faulty  either the motherboard or the proc i am not sure  the technology evolving very quickly in 6 years and after some research i quickly came across this i5 12400f at the very good value for money well i am very satisfied it s faster in everything i make a lot of first video and i gained in comfort there are fewer freeze on the big montages i used the fans supplied  no worries  it heats up little and the thermal paste is pre installed for a low  budget upgrade  cm pro around 250 euros  it is a very good configuration i was able to keep the whole of my old pc  box  graphics card power  with the nvme hard drive and my 2 ram bars without worries 
569,2024-05-22,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,bought this for a new build i was doing  performed great for the price and runs cool just using the stock cooler it came with  no hesitation in recommending for quality and performance verses price
570,2023-12-07,5,29999,Belgium,12400F,hello  it is not yet climbing but for the price of 103 euros at the time of black friday  it was impossible to miss this i5 12400f it is good for gaming in fhd  hd hd and 4k  we can overclock with certain motherboard for streaming no problem and the small pro application without too much rendering etc  it will also do the trick if you send below the 130 euros go there you will not be disappointed  in  it compatible ddr4 and ddr5 therefore can be evolved in a config look forward to finishing the config 
571,2024-05-05,5,29999,Spain,12400F,it offers good performance and good temperatures at a good price  both to play and office editing 
572,2024-03-25,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,excellent 
573,2022-10-12,5,29999,Australia,12400F,well nuff said it works  5 stars for you sir
574,2024-05-26,5,29999,France,12400F,play video processor at the top which runs very well all the games even in big resolution i m going to stream and the tests that i have done for now are very positive with very little lag this version of i5 can completely compete against old version of i7 pose on the motherboard and very easy i did not know but the fan is included in it with a paste to stick the processor the fixing of it are correct and easy to fix very good product  i recommend 👍
575,2024-04-10,5,29999,Spain,12400F,from the moment i installed this intel processor on my computer  i was impressed by its exceptional performance despite its affordable price  this processor handles all my daily tasks with ease  from web navigation to text processing and video edition what really highlights is its ability to handle multiple applications simultaneously without slowing down in addition  its energy efficiency is remarkable  which means that it is not only good for my pocket  but also for the environment in short  this intel processor offers a perfect balance between price and performance it is an excellent choice for anyone looking to update their system without spending a fortune i recommend it a lot 
576,2024-02-04,5,29999,Germany,12400F,great for the price  i only have one application open anyway  i e  every game runs without problems 
577,2024-02-05,5,29999,Belgium,12400F,for a first pc configuration  i set a budget of 1200 euros for this type of configuration  the i5 12400f is frankly recommended to see in use
578,2024-04-29,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,arrived in good condition and very fast
579,2024-05-09,5,29999,Italy,12400F,it is the cpu of the moment for price quality ratio  it always depends on the use you have to do  but anyway efficient also for the gaming obviously not extreme as it is a f and not a k     perfect for build like mine with 16gbram ddr4  rtx 4060  silent with standard heatsink
580,2024-05-23,4,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,would be useful to specify which boards it will work with as plug and play no longer exist 
581,2023-05-31,4,29999,Australia,12400F,it great if you re trying to make a mid range pc but you could spent a little more and get the i5 12600k or the i5 13500
582,2023-09-11,5,29999,Germany,12400F,great processor delivery took place after 1 day in the price range the best processor you can get to  in my opinion use it for 9 months and i am very satisfied the enclosed cooler is also  okay  he cools the processor sufficiently but not necessarily quietly  d i would rather advise a good cpu cooler  don t cost much either
583,2023-12-05,4,29999,Spain,12400F,i caught it very cheap but i don t know if i made a good choice  with a 3060 of 12 gb  i still have problems when rendering videos  i think i would recommend an effort by the i7 12 generation  but this i5 i see it short
584,2023-06-07,3,29999,Australia,12400F,what’s that noise  oh it’s a broken cooler fan blade  intel qa must have missed this one… shame
585,2024-01-17,4,29999,France,12400F,the delivery went well  in time  but the cardboard box was slightly damaged on the corners the processor itself is excellent  very good value for money very satisfied
586,2023-08-29,4,29999,Belgium,12400F,i love this cpu and its price tag  it can handle the newest games well and works quite well for graphic design applications  the only issue i have with this is your ram is locked to a maximum of 3200mhz  if you want to get it higher  consider a 12400kf
587,2023-12-23,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,good single thread performance with 6 cores and 12 threads  relatively low power too  65w so suitable for silent pc  at much lower price point than t coded cpus  35w  
588,2024-06-07,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,it arrived very well packed  fast and everything as shown but my pc is not yet complete so i can only test another time eventually but no problem because this purchase is really reliable 
589,2024-01-17,4,29999,Italy,12400F,this processor  without integrated video card in the possibility of overclocking  is an excellent choice for those looking for good performances for both working use and gaming i bought it to assemble it on the pc on which i use most programs such as ligthroom ecce and i was very satisfied with it i am also satisfied with its gaming performance where it allows me to play in qhd  obviously with dedicated video card  in aaa games like cyberpunk 2077  the processor is fast and reliable  i have not encountered any problems after almost a year or performancenor  after mounted a good after market dissipator  of temperatures speaking of temperatures  the only flaw  mounting the heatsink in stock temperatures  even with little load  stood at 70 degrees you are forced to take an after market dissatrue the price is very competitive compared to other processors of the same price range also today that the 14th generation has come out  if you have to make a budget configuration i would say that it is an excellent choice 
590,2023-12-08,5,29999,Belgium,12400F,good processor 
591,2024-04-03,5,29999,Italy,12400F,if you want to build an economic building  this is a good processor especially when it goes in first discount i recommend replacing the stock digger with something more valid and silent  but if you are really restricted as a budget  the stock is also fine he can still say his in 2024  especially if combined with a good video card  eg rx 6600  and a decent motherboard 
592,2024-05-31,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,in my opinion this is the best price you will find a 12 generation i5 it arrived very fast look that i live in an end of the world 
593,2023-06-02,1,29999,Australia,12400F,received this today  cpu was pre used and rattling around in the box in a sandwich bag  thermal paste smeared around the cooler and cpu 
594,2024-06-08,5,29999,Germany,12400F,i used this cpu for my first ever pc build i pared it with an rtx 3050 6gb eagle edition its works together great
595,2024-04-27,5,29999,Spain,12400F,a processor with very good performance  good quality  very correct temperatures and above all very good price 
596,2024-05-12,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,i really liked that they delivered it with care and it was on time  that was the most important part  so it was timely and they delivered it with less than a day  i like the quality but cant say it’s the best 7 5   10 i hope it came with a cooler for all this money tho cuz i aint keeping this if it didn’t i legit spent 100 quid on this over that  so hopefully it did
597,2024-04-15,5,29999,Italy,12400F,the cpu is exactly as described and in the quality as expected from intel  very good
598,2024-04-22,5,29999,Spain,12400F,the processor is the best in price performance  but if oc is also made by bclk it is insurmountable 
599,2023-10-11,1,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,still waiting for my refund after a faulty mother board ruined the cpu and possibly my gpu amson customer service is terrible have absolutely no understanding of technical stuff and couldn t care less that i m sat here with no computer unable to make aliving and won t even compensate for the rest of the damage the faulty mother board has caused to my pc quick enough to take my money but every excuse under the sun not to give it bk
600,2024-04-19,4,29999,Germany,12400F,i am absolutely enthusiastic about the cpu for the price there is nothing to complain about when it comes to gaming  i think the cpu is also aimed at such first of all  there are only 2 minus points that for me personally are not so important 1 no igpu without its own graphics card no picture 2 boxed cooler can be disposed of immediately  despite the specified 65watt  with boxed cooler over 80 degrees then to the plus points   power for degrees once € 119 you get a cpu with which you actual game above the60 fps brand can be banged  temparatures even if the boxed cooler is not to be used  the cpu can also keep cooler with a normal air  € 20 to 52 degrees  which is absolutely top there is simply nothing to complain about for this price and every 1080p player up to 144hertz should enjoy the cpu system asus h61 gaming matx board intel i5 12400f 2x16gb ddr4 corsair memory ghost gainward 3060 12gb aero cool 550 lux 2x500gb ssd crucial you don t need it as long as you don t play in 4k
601,2024-03-05,4,29999,Brazil,12400F,better cost benefit from intel to work
602,2024-06-01,5,29999,France,12400F,very good processor for the price
603,2023-11-25,1,29999,Belgium,12400F,i ordered the cpu but when it arrived  a fan propeller was broken 
604,2024-06-17,5,29999,Germany,12400F,is a mega good cpu does a job mega
605,2024-05-17,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,if you think about setting up a new set up without spending a lot on a processor and yet have a good performance on your tasks and games  choose this the cost benefit is excellent 
606,2024-04-27,5,29999,Spain,12400F,i bought it  as cpu for my son s first computer and it was a very good purchase  the games go great next to a graphic 3080 
607,2023-12-13,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,was going for a top end 1080p build and from all the reviews i’d read  the 12400f seemed like the best option  easy to instal  came with a cooling fan although i chose to use a bigger air cooler 
608,2022-10-21,1,29999,Australia,12400F,came in with broken fans on delivery
609,2024-04-19,5,29999,France,12400F,super for games walking nickel  6800  on the other hand do not have a graphic part so do not forget to connect the screen to the graphics card and not on the motherboard otherwise black screen no detected signal 
610,2024-03-26,5,29999,Italy,12400F,tested a couple of weeks coupled with an rtx 3070 on some online games  i think it is a really excellent processor  it is descending price or with various offers is between 120 and 130 euros and at this price i don t think you can ask for better the only drawback will be the new architecture  it will be the bios of the mothers  but the turbo core does not go to 4 4ghz on all cores simultaneously  as was the previous series 6xxx 7xxx or on the x99 or x299 platforms the famous option  enhanced turbo boost it is not implemented here  but stops at 4 gigahertz    i don t think it can change much in gaming  given several comparative videos also with i7 and i9 of the same series and the fps are practically the same    which leavesseveral questions about the meaning or not to spend 3 times a lot to get little or nothing more  always remaining in the gaming field  in productivity surely processors with multiple threads will make the difference 
611,2024-01-23,5,29999,Spain,12400F,the need to buy a beautiful cheap processor and price quality when i pay it  i came to luxury now  now i spend with good save and from 10 to go ahead 
612,2023-04-26,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,i am not a gamer but like to keep reasonably up to date and this intel cpu fits the bill for me  its fast and works well with my motherboard  reasonably priced for what it does  the cooler provided is ok for my needs as well but can get a bit noisy when the cpu remains at high   for some time  but overall very happy with this processor 
613,2024-02-02,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,i use basically for flight simulator and answered perfectly  but i suggest using a water cooler during the simulation it was reaching 72º with the original cooler with water cooler 240 fell to 45th 
614,2024-06-18,5,29999,France,12400F,use for gaming and nothing to report turn like a clock  0 crash 
615,2024-05-12,5,29999,Italy,12400F,excellent quality price  we will see over time
616,2024-06-06,5,29999,Germany,12400F,sorry for writing i m too lazy but everything is great 
617,2024-05-08,5,29999,Spain,12400F,very happy to be a mid  range processor i come from the socket x99  asus non  chinese plate  and well it was already difficult to modernize to my pc with the ddr5 and pcie 5 0 so i opt for the socket 1700 and specpet z790 and well i come from a 5820k also of 6 nuclei and 12hils like this processorbut in the benchmark that i have done  i really give it 45  more yield because 5820k had it at 4 40ghz too if it were stock because it would be almost twice as much as powerful  as i had to buy almost all thecomponents to modernize i throw through this since it is the most balanced processor for its price range when it recovers something will happen to another more powerful but with my 1080i it goes more than plenty 
618,2024-06-20,5,29999,France,12400F,don t heat too much with a stable and powerful good ventirad
619,2024-03-16,5,41100,Brazil,12600K,the processor is wonderful  a real monster  bullet for games and multitasking  and contrary to what they say is a processor comes cold  i m very pleased 
620,2024-05-31,5,41100,Japan,12600K,play video i was a very good processor   
621,2023-03-14,5,41100,Singapore,12600K,12600k is faster comparing to my 3900x same on 3200mhz  8gb x4   more snappy when switching charts  intel graphics driver doesn t support multi monitors well in windows 10  seems to be okay in windows 11  it cannot remember monitor relative postion when resume from sleep  no other issues found 
622,2023-08-29,5,41100,Mexico,12600K,i have used the processor already some time and i have not had problems with it  simply perfect
623,2024-05-23,5,41100,Canada,12600K,bought it to replace my old i7 6700k   is doing well and helping me reach better performance in games  haven t had any issues with it so far 
624,2023-03-04,5,41100,Germany,12600K,cpu runs great
625,2024-05-23,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i’ve played on this for maybe a week or two  this thing is serious good  ofc purse coming from a guy that used to play on a i3 3rd gen  this is a night and day difference  this thing can support a tonnn of tabs and runs anything stupid fast  would super recommend 
626,2023-09-01,5,41100,the United Kingdom,12600K,got it for £174 from amazon us  which is about £65 cheaper than buying one in the uk  even if you compare it with a 13400  which has a similar performance running at base clock  it is still so much cheaper  £46   if i remember correctly  the cpu does not come with a warranty  which is probably fine as cpus are known to be very durable  so make sure you test it when you receivie it so you know if it s faulty 
627,2024-04-19,3,41100,Singapore,12600K,although cpu box was sealed  package was dented and fractured  yet to install the cpu
628,2024-01-30,5,41100,Canada,12600K,we are so pleased with the results we are getting from this processor  my son recently built a gaming pc for his little sister  she mostly plays fortnight  minecraft  hogwarts legacy etc and she plays on high settings while screen sharing in discord for the fam  and using obs to record her gameplay no problem  we are very happy with the speed and temps we are getting from this i5  glad we chose this affordable   reliable chip  will probably upgrade in a few years when she’s playing more demanding games 
629,2024-01-08,5,41100,Japan,12600K,thanks for completing my build   ps  please ignore the gtx1070 grandpa  i m broke
630,2023-01-22,5,41100,Mexico,12600K,i found it with a discount and it seemed better value for money  beyond that is a good purchase
631,2024-04-14,5,41100,the United States,12600K,upgraded from an i7 8700 to this and its sooooo much faster  def get a nicer ddr5 board so you can upgrade to an 14th gen when those drop down but  for now the 12600k is nice for my rx 7800xt
632,2024-04-25,4,41100,Mexico,12600K,maybe it was my fault i did not read well but it comes without a dissipator 
633,2024-05-19,5,41100,the United States,12600K,ble operation  first class product 
634,2023-08-27,3,41100,the United Kingdom,12600K,fast and effective processor  was delivered by dpd who jammed this through the letterbox  crushing the packaging  it was unclear whether this was damaged until it was fitted  fortunately it worked  this was purchased as part of a custom games pc build  other delivery companies were ok  amazon left stuff on the doorstep as per usual  royal mail were excellent  seeing if anyone was in  or hiding the product and leaving a note of the location 
635,2023-09-15,5,41100,Japan,12600K,good quality product  i received messages about the location of my goods  so i always knew where it was and how long it would take to arrive  the packaging is good  performance is good 
636,2023-08-11,4,41100,France,12600K,only concerns  it is missing the thermal paste i had to go buy it in a shop otherwise it s nickel 
637,2024-05-04,5,41100,Canada,12600K,does everything and plays everything with a great clock speed for gaming before and after oc’ing
638,2024-05-13,5,41100,the United States,12600K,the 12600k cpu has been an outstanding upgrade from my previous setup  delivering a remarkable boost in performance  i ve been particularly impressed by its cool operation  maintaining a stable 64 degrees even during rigorous stress tests and extended gaming sessions  the cpu comfortably reaches 5 1 ghz without any stability issues  and it seems there s still plenty of room for further overclocking if needed  if you re looking for a cpu that offers solid performance  low heat  and great value  the 12600k is a fantastic choice  highly recommended for both gaming and general productivity 
639,2024-03-24,5,41100,Canada,12600K,very good cpu  paired with 7800xt and everything runs cool  dont forget to buy a cpu cooler with thermal paste and your good to go
640,2023-05-13,5,41100,Japan,12600K,not bad
641,2023-09-15,2,41100,France,12600K,good great for the price  but sold as a box  so impregnated with ventirad     which is not the case 
642,2023-09-04,4,41100,Mexico,12600K,in general it is a good product but its temperature management does not like it  on the one hand you can have a 50 ° c nucleus while another is at 34 ° c and another at 29 ° c and have  rare  jumps from equal 29 to 45 ° c and that out of control a bit the management of the dissipator this is using a new gigabyte b760m ds3h ax and liquid cooling corsair hydro h60  i come from using an amd fx 8350  which was heated a lot and that is why i get used to liquid cooling and with that fx always had temperatures in republic of about 25° c without rare jumps and with the same h60 and tdp of 125w   it should be noted that knowing the buckling problem that this series  lga 1700  has installed from the beginning a thermalright pressure plate so that this problem does not happen so far everything works well has never gone from 60 ° c but those temperature jumps in different parts of the processor still do me 
643,2023-11-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,decided to finally upgrade from my 6 or 7 year old asus x99 platform and 980ti sli  yes that old  to an asus tuf z790 12600k tuf 4080 oc gamers edition  my old 5820k was creating a huge bottleneck issue for my gpu  which i installed about a month prior  what a difference i must say  now that i m finally out of the stone age  i m in awe as to how much things have changed in the pc gaming world  this current build smokes everything i throw at it so far  which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks  i paired the processor and gpu with water blocks from an aio corsair system for my cpu  and a separate granzon custom loop for the gpu  all i can say is wow  fast boot times  150 plus fps in some games like the division 2 with medium settings at 1440p  i highly recommend this processor z790 motherboard gpu combo  are there better options for better performance or there  absolutely  but for the money  i believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform  i was skeptical at first  as this is the first i5 processor i ever purchased for a pc  but as i stated previously  i am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith  again  i highly recommend this processor  can t beat the performance at this price point with a stick 
644,2024-01-28,5,41100,Canada,12600K,i m coming from a 2nd gen i5 to this so needless to say anything is better in comparison  however  in application this chip manages to perform extremely well  changing former powerpoints into actual playable games 
645,2023-09-03,3,41100,Mexico,12600K,i did not ask if i was brought and then reviewing the publication i saw that it is not specified anywhere  to take into account before putting your pc greetings
646,2023-01-31,5,41100,Japan,12600K,there is a lot of stability the level is that the performance is like this however  the performance has nothing to do with it  but i can t like the shape why did you make this shape    
647,2023-01-24,5,41100,Japan,12600K,data processing is fast and easy to handle
648,2024-06-09,4,41100,Canada,12600K,works fine   thought ever cpu came with a cooler but i guess i was mistaken   was rattling around in the box but it works fine no damage
649,2024-04-27,5,41100,the United States,12600K,despite of being an older generation it can play any game you put in front of it  great deal  100  worth it 
650,2024-03-05,5,41100,Canada,12600K,for the price  you cant get better  it completely changed my gaming experience  absolutely recommend
651,2022-10-09,5,41100,Japan,12600K,goodness that was exhausted
652,2024-05-09,5,41100,the United States,12600K,peru  spanish  if you have doubts to buy through amazon  i can assure you that it is 100  reliable purchase processes are easy and totally safe the resettlement system they provide is very complete and above all the deliveries are punctual i bought an intel core i5 12600k processor  and yet amazon s mistake  i received an intel core i5 14700kf obviously it is a much better and more expensive product it arrived totally sealed  well packaged and long before expected peru  english  i bought an intel core i5 12600k processor and for sum amazon mistake i ended review an intel core i5 14600kf a hug mistake from them but  oh well  im enjoying it so far couldn t return ital a it was was going to take a lot of time and cost me totally recommended for videogames  streaming and of course any kind of desingning and photo jobs 
653,2024-06-15,5,41100,the United States,12600K,it is a spectacular processor   the price is very low for all the benefits and power it has 
654,2024-06-18,5,41100,the United States,12600K,intel rarely decepts very good product
655,2024-05-10,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i saw many reviews before deciding on this processor  and if at the same time an attractive price for you do not hesitate  the delivery time was the indicated without problems  and the performance is supposed to be a bit above 7600x  but i will do myown tests when the dissipator arrives  to finish assembling my pc
656,2024-06-05,5,41100,the United States,12600K,good price value
657,2024-04-29,5,41100,the United States,12600K,got this a few months back for a sale price i have yet to see repeated anywhere  i can t believe the step up from my 9600k that i have 17  overclocked and this one i have not overclocked yet 
658,2024-05-25,5,41100,the United States,12600K,great
659,2024-04-15,5,41100,the United States,12600K,bought this for my second computer  and can say it is the budget king at the moment  it does not overclock very well though compared to a 13600k  i tested this cpu with a 3080  and 4080 and can say it gets the job done  but at 1080p i saw bottlenecking with both graphics cards 
660,2024-04-15,5,41100,the United States,12600K,this little beast is on par with new ryzen 7700x and can handle all games 144 fps if you pair it with a 4080  hands down best cpu on 2022 and still rocking on 2023 2024
661,2024-04-24,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i have never had an issue with an intel processor in 30 years so i m going to keep buying them 
662,2023-12-21,5,41100,the United States,12600K,this processor with the rebuild of our desktop build has been very loyal and powerful  mixed with a deepcool ak620 and non overclocked i finally figure out the formula too achieve 4k ultra gaming on most games that i play on a regular basis  i play numerous of strategy games but i do also play grand theft auto  as an escape     american truck simulator as of late and roblox  the processing performance has been excellent  i hope that one day i can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages  basically said it s it s 12th generation processor and that s been recent in the past two to three years  it is on the mid range of the spectrum for intel i5  but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it s processed what it has to process  i can go through a hundred tabs an hour and not have to worry about internal latency  it s good
663,2024-04-13,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i ve been with the product for a long time and so far not a fault
664,2024-04-18,5,41100,the United States,12600K,this article is very useful
665,2024-01-26,5,41100,the United States,12600K,this processor is magnificent  a quality  moves the entire multitasking  its integrated graphics are magnificent  moves fornite in middle graphics all in high to 60 120 fps  it is not uncomfortable to play with some games  it endures a lot  i carry several tests ofstress  i took 5 days doing followed calculations sometimes with the processor at 100  i have not failed  excellent product  just remember that it comes without the stock dissipator and that i recommend you put a tower dissipator  a noctua  aerocool  aerocool  aerocool themaltake or deepcool   it is more than enough  it has never risen from 65 degrees  a complete beauty
666,2023-12-24,5,41100,the United States,12600K,bought for a mini itx build for my daughter when it was on sale for  149 99  felt like a nice value for q4 2023  didn t overclock this one  but could as it runs at just 48 degrees celsius under load from cinebench r23 with the  just barely fits in the case  thermalright peerless assassin 120 se arbg  side note  for anybody building a pc  that peerless assassin is the cpu air cooling champion at   40  this 12600k processor is more power hungry than some of it s amd competitors  but having recently purchased an amd 7800x3d for my own computer that s requiring a bit more work to optimize and get running properly  this 12600k was perfect  intel stuff in my experience just tends to run good 
667,2024-04-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,good price
668,2023-12-17,5,41100,the United States,12600K,purchased for  150 for cyber monday 2023 and it s been excellent  in cyberpunk 2077  with ray tracing on and a mix of ultra high settings  i ve reached 60 120 fps  usually hovering between 70 90  with a gigabyte eagle 4060  i ve hit 500  fps in league of legends  and with v sync on  i ve had no noticeable drop from 165 fps  on sale  this is an excellent processor and an incredible upgrade from my previous 9400f which was and still is a very capable processor  temps are very stable with a peerless assassin cooler  i don t believe i ve reached or exceeded 60 degrees celsius  i haven t overclocked yet   if i even will  because current performance is excellent   but i ve read that this processor overclocks a fair amount 
669,2024-04-03,5,41100,the United States,12600K,works good and temps don’t get too high
670,2024-03-30,5,41100,the United States,12600K,very good for a good price but there are better options for less money
671,2024-03-30,5,41100,the United States,12600K,assembled my pc and it s working great  just as expected 
672,2024-04-01,5,41100,the United States,12600K,it arrived in time and works great
673,2024-04-01,5,41100,the United States,12600K,great processor  equipment operating well and excellent
674,2024-03-28,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i like it 
675,2024-02-29,5,41100,the United States,12600K,system posted and my temps are staying low while overclocked  everything has been stable so far  gaming and home use shouldn t be a problem at all 👍🏼
676,2024-01-06,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i bought this the 12600k together with arc a750 for new pc build  the mainboard i use is asus prime b660m a wifi d4  i tested the cpu with cinebench  it was using 125 watts  the temperature was 70c with single tower cooler and no extra fans and also the mainboard was cool  i m using this pc for video games and i like the 12600k so far 
677,2024-03-07,5,41100,Canada,12600K,not going to fan boi or tell you to pick on over the other  current ryzen 5 or i5 are going to give you what you need if your just looking for a solid but affordable gaming cpu  i went with the one that had the least investment required which just happened to be the i5 12600k  already had a solid set of 4x8 cl14 3600mhz and 7000 series amd would have required ddr5  and set me back an additional 150   only reason i went intel over amd  not ads  not influencers just boiled down to  
678,2023-12-30,5,41100,Canada,12600K,this cpu is probably one of the best bangs for the buck at 200  compared to others of similar quality i know cuz i bought a r5 7600 a year ago back for 300  not the point this cpu replaced an i5 8400 i originally upgraded the gpu from a 1060 6gb to a 1660 super and only got a a few fps increase the reason being while games were starting it would bottom out at 10fps before returning to normal we were than at the time before cpu upgrade bottoming out at 13fps now after upgrading cpu i noticed the fps is now 27fps at its lowest while i understand most gamers would do anything for a single fps i just don t feel the end result is as great as i was hoping however my goal was reached by increasing the minimum fps also has overclocking capability but have not tried to play with any of that as of writing this nor am i comfortable with doing so
679,2024-02-05,5,41100,the United States,12600K,a good product doesn t need an explanation  i have always trusted this store and every purchase is without any problems  this intel core is really user friendly  it won t make my computer overheat  and the storage space is also very sufficient
680,2023-11-03,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i used this cpu in a recent build for a secondary computer that i will game on at a secondary residence  it performs very well even in demanding flight simulation applications  the onboard video is a nice feature to have if you remove the video gpu to swap it out   etc and you still have the ability to enter the uefi bios  windows 10 11  etc  the k suffix denotes that the cpu can be slightly overclocked if you wish to do that  good price on a great 12th gen intel cpu  works great when paired with both my nvidia and amd gpu s  no compatibility issues have arisen 
681,2024-01-27,5,41100,the United States,12600K,when priced under  175  you simply cannot go wrong with this cpu  not only is it a powerful chip with manageable thermals  its socket is also compatible with even the newest intel cpus should you choose to upgrade 
682,2024-03-10,5,41100,the United States,12600K,good temperatures and incredible performance 👌🏾👌🏾🌟
683,2024-02-05,5,41100,the United States,12600K,this intel core is really user friendly  i didn t choose it wrong  it was the way i expected it to be  it added battery life to my computer and ran very smoothly 
684,2023-12-30,5,41100,the United States,12600K,intel i5 g12 processor with integrated graphics  yields excellent with its basic frequency without the need of the turbo mode heat when it is required too much  nothing that a good air cooling does not keep fresh excellent processing with its 10 real cores and 16 threads highly recommended for its cost   benefit ratio 
685,2023-12-25,5,41100,the United States,12600K,just built a new machine with an msi board and did not want to spend too much  this cpu has decent performance and was over  100 less than the next generation up  my board will accept 12  13 and 14 gen cpu s so maybe i will update in a few years 
686,2024-01-15,5,41100,the United States,12600K,it works perfectly after installation and the temperature is constant  the socket is very tight and requires some force  so i thought the pin would be damaged or the edge would be crushed  but i finished anyway 
687,2024-02-29,5,41100,the United States,12600K,excellent 100  functional product 
688,2023-12-23,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i m loving my newly build  but still don t know what gpu to buy  so i m stuck to igpu    have not experiencing issue so far with this cpu  i m using the igpu and it lets me play dota 2 on medium settings at 1440p which is awesome 
689,2024-01-29,5,41100,the United States,12600K,excellent price performance over the budget 13 gen i5s  p cores push all core 4 9 no problem with even a budget dual tower air cooler 
690,2024-02-20,5,41100,the United States,12600K,perfect for this price  working good
691,2024-01-21,5,41100,the United States,12600K,have the cpu paired up with a 3060ti  32gb of ram and 2 1tb m 2 ssd  works amazing  avg 145fps on most games
692,2023-12-28,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i am just your average budget gamer  i upgraded from a i5 6500 and oh boy the difference in speed in gaming and productivity is night and day  love this  bought it on black friday sale  best buy 
693,2023-08-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,it fulfills everything that promises  i understand is a good investment  because i can use it for both gaming and work  excellent performance for a normal person ita as i is super  because i have also used 12700 and they are very similar in terms of performance  despite the fact that 12700 has more nuclei and that its consumption is lower  i have felt more stability in 12600k note i do not do oc i always use that in stock i have it accompanied by rtx3080 and 64gb from ram to 3600mhz and i have another one that i have already taken since this generation with 32gb of ram at 4400mhz and they are a pass for me one with refrigeration nzxt z53 and the other with noctua nhd15s and the temperatures are handled in both cases 
694,2023-10-27,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i built my first  budget  gaming rig this year and paired this cpu with an rtx 3060 and 64gb ddr4 ram   i m running msfs 2020 and averaging 40 45 fps on ultra settings  also playing starfield and jedi survivor both on high graphics and they re smooth as butter on a 2k 32  monitor  using a deepcool cooler and a thermaltake case with good airflow  i haven t seen this cpu get above 60 degrees yet under high load  100  happy with it 
695,2022-07-07,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i recently built an 15 12600k system and it has plenty of ups and downs  i don t see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or intel  most of the issues i have experienced with the new system  and there have been many   have to do with the motherboard or ddr5  i upgraded from a i7 4770k i had on a 24 7 4 8ghz overclock for 7 years  the new i5 is clearly faster in both single and multi threaded performance  like many i experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core  at the end of the day i don t see any real world effects on performance  and even microsoft says to ignore these errors  i have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support  i ve had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened  if amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective  i may have to reconsider them  i am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better  i would recommend the i5 12600k to anyone looking for a reasonably priced new chip that will allow their systems to handle most tasks with ease for the foreseeable future 
696,2023-10-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i purchased this cpu to build my wife a new desktop pc  she games some but primarily uses the machine to run adobe creative cloud suite  she is prone to multi tasking and can run the sims 4 with 1 000 mod files  baldur s gate 3 at medium settings  and watch her favorite streaming shows simultaneously  currently her rig only has a used gtx 1060 gpu card and we are budgeting for a new 4060 but even with just the old 1060 from her old rig she can still multitask games and adobe apps to her heart s content 
697,2023-12-01,5,41100,the United States,12600K,wow what an incredible black friday deal  seriously   153 is well worth it for the performance  i also purchased the 12700k for  211 which is yet another unbeatable deal offered this holiday season at amazon  if you managed to get your hands on either one of you made the right choice 
698,2023-11-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,no much to say  i caught a decent sale price for a new build  i could probably have saved  70 and gone i3  but i figured lets step up for the extra cores as i don t upgrade my desktop very often  there is not a whole lot of improvement from this gen 12 cpu vs the new gen 14 release  just save the money 
699,2022-08-28,5,41100,the United States,12600K,i’m so glad i decided to step up from the 12600t i was planning on using to the 12600k  which is the cheapest intel cpu that has the efficiency cores  i was nervous at first  because my plan was to build a low ish power  100  passively cooled  internal gpu  no moving parts pc for use in my bedroom  where my previous computers were annoyingly loud  i used a noctua nh p1 passive cooler and a seasonic px 500 fanless psu  and my system is not only 100  silent  it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained cinebench runs   i run my system at  130 mv  with no overclocking  and cpu power consumption peaks at about 100 w  while idle cpu power consumption is less than 2w  my heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use  the only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming pc is the lack of dedicated gpu  but the internal gpu is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of bluestacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game  and fast enough to run diablo iii and eve online with medium settings   the core i5 12600k is roughly competitive in performance and price with the amd ryzen 7 5700x 
700,2023-07-23,5,50200,India,12700,ultimate performance
701,2023-12-21,5,50200,Spain,12700,very good i recommend and deliver quickly 
702,2023-02-26,5,50200,Japan,12700,i bought a pc for the first time in 10 years with the announcement of the armored core vi  so i purchased it  but since the fever is high  i use it in conjunction with the deepcool ak620 cpu cooler  and attach a warped frame and use it as a gaming pc masu the performance of star citizen is not enough for a game  so you may replace it with a 13th generation cpu later i was worried about i7 12700k  but i thought about the balance between performance and power consumption  if the power consumption is large in winter due to the circumstances of the house  the breaker may fall      others have also written  but it is better to purchase a cpu cooler and anti  preventive frame separately if you can take measures such as fever and warpage  it is a product that is satisfactory for general game use  so i decided to ☆ 5 
703,2023-08-02,5,50200,the United Kingdom,12700,upgrade pc with motherboard and graphics card  new board did not facilitate my older processor  bought this as i considered it fast enough for my needs and at a reasonable price  all works great 
704,2024-04-23,5,50200,Germany,12700,works perfectly
705,2024-03-21,5,50200,Italy,12700,very high performance cpu with very powerful incorporated graphic card
706,2024-01-11,5,50200,Germany,12700,gut
707,2022-04-07,5,50200,France,12700,super processor  very powerful  does not heat even with the intel ventil provided ordered sunday received on tuesday      that happiness he wanders in all games 
708,2022-04-17,5,50200,Italy,12700,pass from a 12500 however excellent here we are still on another level a speed of execution increased at least by 50 percent  for only 50 euros of difference i have far preferred this to a 12600k not affecting the overclocking speech combined with an msi coreliquid 240 v2 liquid  idle temperatures are about 23 degrees and under stress do not reach 50 thanks to its very low tdp best value for money for what i m concerned 
709,2024-03-07,4,50200,the United Kingdom,12700,costs a lot and i do not recommend to anyone with a tight budget like £900 if you have a tight budget i suggest the ryzen 5 5600x but overall the cpu is great and it works perfectly fine with any game
710,2023-08-19,5,50200,Spain,12700,new format  but great the problem is windows 11  i don t know when it will take off 
711,2022-12-22,4,50200,Japan,12700,intel has been since slot 1 i still think that the same price range is amd however  the cpu socket changed to am5 and i searched for mb of am4 in a hurry  but all of them are expensive the highest mb of gigabite was only when imported from the united states therefore  when searching for the company s mb  the z690 mb for ddr4 was usually almost half price then  i think that it is about the same as the amd 5900x since there are many writings such as  cpu warp   i purchased  example of the example  at the same time i don t know if it s a good product unless i assemble it i m looking forward to 
712,2023-07-02,5,50200,Germany,12700,a cpu that i have been using for more than a year and will probably still do it for the next few years except for windows  whatever   she has never reached almost high utilization in games or compiling 
713,2023-10-05,5,50200,France,12700,corresponds to the photo and the description superb very correct product packaging
714,2022-03-05,5,50200,Germany,12700,what intel delivers in the 12th processor generation is almost unbelievable after amd has mercilessly hung up the intel competition in recent years  the situation has now changed completely the i7 12700  currently boxed approx  € 350  is a duel at eye level with the amd r9 5900x  currently boxed approx  € 460  for the technology enthusiasts briefly a few self determined cinebench values ​​ r23   r9 5900x  single core 1581 points   multi core 22126 points i7 12700  single core 1902 points   multi core 22069 points run both systemswith 32gb ddr4 3200 memory  cl16  1 35v xmp profile   the cpus without any overclocking chipset intel  b660  chipset amd  b550    clear purchase recommendation 
715,2022-07-27,3,50200,the United Kingdom,12700,before buying keep in mind that you might need a good cooler  i bought noctua d15 which is very good at cooling and it costs me more than €100  so add more €100 while thinking to buy any intel high end processors   the delivery was also late 
716,2022-06-19,4,50200,Spain,12700,almost perfect  just for the price 
717,2022-02-21,5,50200,France,12700,cpu almost as powerful as model k  between 2 and 5  difference  and easier to manage thermally because 2 times more sober in electricity consumption 
718,2022-03-31,5,50200,Japan,12700,recently  i used ryzen cpus  but i looked at benchmarks and changed the intel cpu i have used so far into this i think the feeling of use is a really good cpu i was able to experience the goodness immediately just by the speed of windows 
719,2023-01-23,4,50200,Italy,12700,excellent very quiet product
720,2022-02-18,5,50200,Japan,12700,of course  the fps of the black desert image quality low setting has risen from 100 150 to 130 243 
721,2023-07-21,5,50200,Germany,12700,one of the best computer processor 
722,2022-11-12,5,50200,Italy,12700,just unbeatable value for money the best if you want to spend the right without mortgaging the house 
723,2023-02-07,5,50200,Spain,12700,it works well although the stock fan cools little and you have to buy liquid cooling if you do not want it to be put at 100 grades  in very demanding clear tasks 
724,2022-07-18,5,50200,France,12700,purchased to replace an i9 9900  very effective 
725,2023-02-16,5,50200,France,12700,perfect for a good workstation and more if affinity
726,2023-05-26,5,50200,Germany,12700,best decision for virtualization 
727,2023-02-20,5,50200,Italy,12700,very versatile cpu being that i use it for various functions  but under effort during gaming it is present and stable including heatsink 
728,2022-08-18,1,50200,Germany,12700,after the first cpu only worked for a good 1 month i have been waiting for guarantee processing through intel for over 2 months i have never experienced anything like it now i m ready for ryzen 
729,2022-04-29,3,50200,France,12700,the processor and the fan look new but the packaging has already been opened upon reception the scotch that closes the packaging seems to be open several times  suspected of being re     expired real processors otherwise  the processor has no problem at the moment
730,2023-03-06,5,50200,Italy,12700,i received the product earlier than expected and everything is exceptional i recommend the purchase 
731,2022-09-22,3,50200,Japan,12700,the cpu is boxed  but the memory is a paper pack  and if you pack it tightly  it will damage the memory package can i take responsibility if the operation is bad    since there is an elevator to fill the post  go up to the room   
732,2022-03-15,5,50200,Germany,12700,i have had this cpu for a few weeks now  i am impressed with its performance  however  it definitely needs a a better cooler  the one provided in the box is not sufficient even for single threaded workloads  though i guess this is expected    
733,2023-04-10,5,50200,Italy,12700,excellent very fast processor
734,2023-06-03,5,50200,Italy,12700,i7 is always i7
735,2023-02-26,5,50200,Italy,12700,that a processor can be said i needed for a build more than satisfied used for shipcontructtor
736,2022-09-27,5,50200,Italy,12700,recently purchased this processor of 12th gen i must say that it is a bomb  both as regards gaming and for the management of other programs unlike the i9 he warms half    in short  i recommend 
737,2022-09-29,5,50200,Italy,12700,very versatile cpu you can do everything from work to gaming without problems  i recommend replacing the noisy stock dissatrator under stress  perhaps with a liquid system 
738,2022-10-22,5,50200,Italy,12700,excellent and fast processor  tested and tried  for the moment it has not given me problems
739,2022-11-15,5,50200,Italy,12700,it pushes like a wild boar  but in certain scenarios he warms like an animal
740,2022-08-10,5,50200,Italy,12700,excellent high  end cpu x those who in addition to gaming want something more
741,2022-05-18,5,50200,Italy,12700,excellent processor  no noise arrived in an excellent packaging with air dissatator excellent value for money 
742,2022-06-05,3,50200,Italy,12700,can i know why the box has been opened and damaged i bought it new  but it seems that they played football with him
743,2022-06-28,5,60000,India,12700K,no doubt  12th gen intel processors are a marvel of computing technology  although there is a continuing tug of war between intel and amd in this regard  i personally chose intel core i7  12700k  with inbuilt uhd graphics for my newly built desktop pc  for those  who don t want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards  this processor is a very good alternative  it can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of blender easily with its unlocked overclocking  obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard  i e  presently available z690 chipset motherboards   it can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of adobe lightroom and photoshop with no hiccups  not to mention the support of 4k video with hdr if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your pc  i would suggest this 12th gen i7 to those who want to use their pc for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money  compared to 12th gen i9  which would ideally be the best anyway  but costlier too   the price is still at a high level  hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of intel s 13th gen processors 
744,2022-03-29,5,60000,India,12700K,i have paired this processor with asus prime z690a motherboard and 32g 5200mhz ddr5 ram  my usage is mostly for adobe suite for 4k video rendering   photoediting  without dedicated egpu  and ocassonal aaa title gaming like gta5  battlefield  cpunk etc  the processor works like a charm for rendering and games upto 75hz in 1080p ultra setting  overall good processor for the price and more review to come in future edits 
745,2024-04-02,5,60000,Australia,12700K,working well  stable and can be overclock   with correct cooling setup  good price too 
746,2024-05-23,5,60000,Canada,12700K,does exactly what it s supposed to do  my computer works great
747,2023-12-29,5,60000,Singapore,12700K,good value purchase to build a system 
748,2024-04-10,5,60000,the United Kingdom,12700K,so  being an amd fanboy  i was not keen on getting this  but the c t  cores to threads  kinda caught my eye  running 12 cores  and 20 threads  4 e cores i think  i thought  well  for the price  it should be okay  i was wrong    this cpu is a monster in my eyes  running with 32gb of ram  ddr4  and matched with the rtx 4070 gpu being cooled by the artic liquid freezer ii  there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max  i would recommend this piece of kit to anyone  starting out or continuing on with building computers for their  high end  gaming etc  i have not once seen this struggle 
749,2023-05-05,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,at the time of buying it i had doubt about whether i would be very mistreated  since it is imported from amazon usit is at a lower price than the rest i highly recommend it  especially for people like me who are assembling their first gamer and work pc and look for piece by piece 
750,2023-07-10,5,60000,Brazil,12700K,it is very fast  but it gets a lot  it even uses 220w in stress test before you buy  try to know in the forums about this issue  no matter which cooler and thermal folder use  it will warm a lot the only solution is to make a slight undervolt  or decrease the loadline calibration on bios it reminded me of the i7 7700k that suffered from the same problem 
751,2024-06-17,5,60000,Japan,12700K,i was too high in high 
752,2024-01-18,5,60000,the United Kingdom,12700K,excellent cpu and great value
753,2023-05-25,5,60000,Japan,12700K,my cpu is quite old  so i upgraded for the first time in 12 years at first i was lost in ryzen  but as a result i decided to buy it the result is very satisfying  and as a result of running the same game as a similar ryzen cpu  my pc is better   lol 
754,2023-10-18,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,i arrive in perfect condition  highly recommended
755,2023-12-28,5,60000,Australia,12700K,basic processor used from my home pc  does exactly what was requested and ordered
756,2023-12-19,5,60000,Singapore,12700K,big upgrade from my 9 years old 5820k 
757,2024-06-12,5,60000,the United States,12700K,great cpu  put it in a new personal gaming rig and it hits 5 3ghz out of the box no tweaking and runs stable as can be  very happy 
758,2024-01-18,5,60000,Canada,12700K,for my needs  it’s the perfect “bang for the buck” balance between performance and price 
759,2023-10-26,5,60000,Italy,12700K,classic intel medium  sided cpu from gaming and productivity perfect packaging and no installation problems given the latest exits of intel cpu of 14  generation  the price should settle around € 280 300 to become a best buy
760,2024-01-17,5,60000,France,12700K,relatively fast delivery and processor delivered new
761,2022-09-11,4,60000,Germany,12700K,good processor  but also costs his money sometimes causes coil fiepen for me  otherwise a good product 
762,2023-01-02,5,60000,Japan,12700K,if you re not going next gen  this is your best option  great price and amazing performance both in gaming and productivity
763,2022-08-11,1,60000,Germany,12700K,i just don t understand why i get a broken cpu that is just unnecessary and time  consuming
764,2024-05-29,5,60000,Canada,12700K,perform
765,2023-05-02,5,60000,Italy,12700K,everything ok
766,2023-07-14,5,60000,the United Kingdom,12700K,intel cpu is good
767,2023-07-26,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,it works perfectly i notice the difference since i come from an eighth generation and with a 4070 gpu i will have more experience about it 
768,2024-01-24,5,60000,the United States,12700K,this is my first intel build coming from past amd builds  ryzen  fx  athlon  phenom   i am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this cpu with instructions followed  this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026  i overclocked this via the motherboard bios settings and it stays cool with a  30 fan cooler   don t get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating  just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate  windows experience rating is a 9 7 so that says it all  if you have the extra 50 60  go with the i9 i should have done that  amd seems to be all the hype but i see why intel won t be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip 
769,2023-08-19,5,60000,Australia,12700K,good       
770,2023-09-25,5,60000,France,12700K,nothing to say and it does not heat  28c at rest  even without water cooling
771,2024-05-02,5,60000,Canada,12700K,greater than 15  15 
772,2022-08-04,1,60000,Japan,12700K,if you attach it to a new motherboard and start it  the red lamp on the led cpu on the motherboard is it broken 
773,2023-05-05,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,a fast and efficient processor  together with a good graphic card  is wonderful
774,2023-05-05,5,60000,Italy,12700K,super
775,2021-12-22,5,60000,Australia,12700K,fast and nice  good shopping experience for me 
776,2024-05-17,5,60000,the United States,12700K,got it as an upgrade over my old 8700k and this is a huge upgrade  i do recommend installing a contact frame such as the thermalright for this cpu
777,2023-09-04,5,60000,Canada,12700K,this is my first 1700 socket processor  so i can t really give it a proper speed review   however it was very simple to install   just be very very careful   
778,2023-03-17,5,60000,France,12700K,arrived on time and the product is very efficient one of the best processor of the perfect moment for today s games which are often cpu bound 
779,2022-12-21,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,a very good product the occupation for software development and the truth is very fast the computer  even if docker occupies 
780,2024-04-10,5,60000,the United States,12700K,i heard good things about this cpu and went for it  budget friendly and a very good cpu 
781,2022-01-03,5,60000,Italy,12700K,finally a nice step forward by intel the processor is really good  park in consumption  powerful both in singles and in multi core and does not heat excessively if you are looking at him here you will probably have already seen countless benchmarks on the web so useless to post them like all the components of a pc  it must be contextualized with respect to the use that a person has to do personally i recommend the purchase
782,2022-10-06,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,no comment
783,2023-03-17,5,60000,Italy,12700K,serious and recommended seller
784,2022-02-05,5,60000,France,12700K,i leave an i7 6700k  6th gen  which had made its job for the new i7 12700k and it is day and night coupled with a cm asus rog stix z690 and the rog ryujin ii 360 cooling  it meets my expectations  i hesitated between the i5 12600k and this one  i do not regret my purchase on the amazon side  nothing to say ordered on tuesday for a reception 48 hours later  thursday 
785,2024-05-23,4,60000,Canada,12700K,exactly what i needed
786,2024-02-03,5,60000,Canada,12700K,got it the next day as stated and was exactly as advertised  yes would buy from again
787,2023-10-04,4,60000,Italy,12700K,the processor is excellent  i use the pc for streaming and gaming and makes its duty without problems but when i bought it  it had risen too much to price compared to other processors and quality price it works very well at the moment  in use for a month 
788,2022-08-16,4,60000,France,12700K,it works well  with enough hearts and lanes to have fun on virtual machines  but i who keep my computer consistently lit  inactive  but with open chrome and around thirty tabs  some of which are acting all by itself  i have increased my consumption compared to my previous 7700k the turbo has just over 5ghz is funny  but it doubles the consumption and therefore the temperature it works well but it gets severe when it activates the turbo  and if we try to correctly ventilate the slightest point gets along 
789,2024-01-09,5,60000,the United States,12700K,just be sure to match up the chip correctly on the socket  one corner has a triangle cutout  easy to install  runs smooth and is not a power hog or a supernova in terms of heat  even at load  it performs well   perfect for gaming  no issues in keeping up with gpu 
790,2022-06-22,5,60000,Italy,12700K,great quality product  planned the purchase for configuring a new pc very satisfied on purchase and delivery times
791,2022-02-06,5,60000,France,12700K,no problem when editing  i mounted a nightua nhu12a fan  when the proc works 100   it remains under 80 ° c in normal operation  the whole is silent be careful if the cm walks at the ddr5  it is twice the price of the ddr5 the gpu works well  video processing  while waiting for graphics cards to return at reasonable prices 
792,2024-03-03,5,60000,the United States,12700K,a great performance  cheap enough for the performance it gives  i got this for 210  on bf  recommend 
793,2024-02-06,5,60000,Canada,12700K,good enough for this price range
794,2024-06-04,5,60000,the United States,12700K,for me the best of the last three generations of intel  a decent tdp  i have no temperature problems or any problem  i recommend it 
795,2024-05-13,5,60000,the United States,12700K,runs microsoft flight simulator on multiple 32  screens beautifully 
796,2024-04-09,5,60000,the United States,12700K,perfect
797,2024-02-17,5,60000,the United States,12700K,great product brand intel i7 cpu  i have been using the intel brand cpu s and have been using the i7 and the k series since they were introduced  this seems to handle video processing and cad cam projects quite well  i have always had great luck with intel brand processors and will continue using them  pretty good value for the cost 
798,2023-12-04,5,60000,the United States,12700K,compared to the coffee lake generation i had been  willingly  stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap  before buying i was a bit skeptical since i m not a fan of intel s newer way of handling cores  but the first thing i tried when i got it was emulating ps3 games and right off the bat i saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled   the older cpus from the 8th  9th  and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if you re on a budget maybe look on the used market for those  but if you really need something powerful this is a good option 
799,2023-08-05,4,60000,the United States,12700K,this item has been with me for a very short time   so i recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig  and after extensive research  i made the bold choice to order the intel core i7 12700k gaming desktop processor with integrated graphics and 12 cores  let me tell you  this processor is the absolute best  with its 12 cores  it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience  whether i m playing graphically demanding aaa titles or indulging in intense multitasking  this processor effortlessly handles it all  and what s even better is that it comes with integrated graphics  meaning i didn t have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card  yet  the integrated graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups  plus  with intel s reputation for reliable and high quality products  i know i can trust the i7 12700k to last me for years to come   i hope you find this review helpful 
800,2024-03-15,5,60000,the United States,12700K,huge upgrade from 8th gen i5  paired it with the asrock z690 and 32g ddr4
801,2023-12-02,4,60000,the United States,12700K,the morning after building and setting up windows  drivers  etc  the pc had blue screened because of temperatures  and after a reset and entering the bios i saw that the temperature was 89 degrees celsius  thankfully  after some trial and error i was able to undervolt it and not have my cpu die  i d suggest anyone who looks into getting an intel cpu to undervolt it 
802,2024-01-12,4,60000,Canada,12700K,the one i bought one year ago had instability  didn t know it was the cpu until it really started acting up  had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the cpu  when i reached out to intel  they informed me about a policy about   tray   processor and   boxed   processor  basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they don t cover warranty  as for boxed processor  they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more  fortunatly  the one i got was a boxed one  but still intel told me i had a   tray   processor  i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a   box   processor  it was a bit unnerving  but at the en  they offered me the warranty and i m supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them 
803,2024-03-19,5,60000,the United States,12700K,used at work 
804,2023-12-10,5,60000,the United States,12700K,at this time in the product life cycle  the 12th gen cpu is about half the cost of the 14th gen cpu  it is more than fast enough for everything i do  my major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have tpm 2 0  the cpu was easy to install  it is running between 36 37 degrees celsius  though i admit i am not stressing it   i am very happy with my purchase 
805,2024-02-05,5,60000,the United States,12700K,i received the product with the promptness of the case i arrive sealed and in a box with another product the operation is good and not usually heated with a good air cooling system 
806,2024-02-25,5,60000,the United States,12700K,this appears to be the best option for intel at this price range  works as advertised 
807,2024-01-29,5,60000,the United States,12700K,i bought it when i was special  and there was no problem in use  and the money was worth it i purchased it at a special price  and i haven t encountered any issues in terms of usage  it offers great value for the money 
808,2024-02-02,5,60000,the United States,12700K,it s a top of the line cpu that will last for a long time  there s nothing to dislike about it  it replaced a 12 year 3770k 
809,2024-01-16,5,60000,the United States,12700K,if you re looking for an intel cpu i would recommend this even though it is a couple years old now i belive its still the best intel cpu for gaming
810,2024-02-25,5,60000,the United States,12700K,play video and see how it behaves when you make my assembly
811,2024-01-24,5,60000,the United States,12700K,went from a 9400f to this was a big different on gaming  i finally get the fully potencial of my gpu
812,2024-03-02,5,60000,the United States,12700K,great
813,2024-02-19,5,60000,the United States,12700K,great cpu  would buy again 
814,2023-12-01,5,60000,the United States,12700K,wow what an incredible black friday deal  seriously   211 is well worth it for the performance  i also purchased the 12600k for  153 which is another unbeatable deal offered this year at amazon  if you managed to get your hands on either one of you made the right choice 
815,2024-01-18,5,60000,the United States,12700K,this is a second purchase of core i7 12700  it works very well as expected 
816,2023-11-30,5,60000,the United States,12700K,for my limited budget  i bought it  while the 12700k isn t the top of the line  at least for me  it was more affordable and very performant  i ve had good success overclocking it and actually undervolting it to reduce temperatures 
817,2023-12-28,5,60000,the United States,12700K,i ve installed a 10th gen 2x  12th gen  and a 13th gen on my family s pc s  i ve never had a problem 
818,2023-08-05,4,60000,Canada,12700K,it s pretty good value for money  as far as intel cpus are concerned     for a 12th gen cpu  but if you re looking for the better value get the i5 13600k which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen cpu  the only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard  otherwise you ll need to flash the bios on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen cpu  i highly do not recommend doing this   i ve tried it a few and it s such a big hassle  many potential issues    that i recommend first time pc builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen cpu  along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard  don t buy 12th gen mobo  which obviously doesn t require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable 
819,2024-01-05,5,60000,the United States,12700K,great cpu for multitasking  i don t know too much about cpu but this is great 
820,2023-07-21,5,60000,the United States,12700K,so far so good  but then that s what i said about the last one    i ll check back in a year on this and hope it outlasts my prior cpu   as for the last one    it s intel dropping the ball with their qc it seems  had an imc function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed  couldn t run any xmp profiles  and swapping the processor solved it  not a mobo issue    just watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen  and return it if  anything  seems even  remotely  off 
821,2023-07-25,5,60000,the United States,12700K,the heart of my pc build and wanted to have the  k  version with the integrated graphics    even though i was going to have a gpu anyways  it s a good backup if the gpu fails   can t do a pro and con here as there is nothing much to report  it plays every game without bottlenecking my rtx 3070 and was a breeze to install  there is literally one way to install it   you d have to intentionally or forcibly install it wrong   also  it runs surprisingly cool and doesn t act like an easy bake oven in my motherboard 
822,2023-07-16,4,60000,the United States,12700K,not much to say about this cpu  it s intel  and these are immortal  still have the 3770k i got like 10 years ago  and an extreme i got even earlier than that   so the main motive here is to let amazon know that i have received the item  but i don t know how to let them know so they can change the  package left at mail  to  already received    
823,2023-11-22,5,60000,the United States,12700K,i got the cpu on sale and i would say the performance is great  my application is running smoothly and does not come into any problem for a year now 
824,2023-11-16,5,60000,the United States,12700K,this thing is a workhorse  ive got mine clocked to 5 0ghz and it runs like a dream  keep in mind this unit will require a water pump air coolers are not enough 
825,2023-06-26,4,60000,the United States,12700K,bought this k to have graphics backup  the cpu is great the graphics not so much  still i do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my pc  but only for the purpose of having temporary backup when needed  so for that purpose it works  the cost vs the kf is fairly negligible so for its primary purpose it is a very good cpu 
826,2023-01-02,5,60000,the United States,12700K,the i7 12700k is in the top 5 for gaming cpus right now  amd is doing fairly well as of late but intel has a solid performance lead with it s single core performance on newer generation chips   if you re on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance  it goes as follows  1  i9 13900k 2  i7 13700k 3  i9 12900k 4  i5 13600k 5  i7 12700k  this chip is no slouch though  it trades blows with the 13600k in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn t really fair for comparison   in conclusion  if you re looking around this price point  check both this cpu and the 13600k  pick whichever is cheaper  higher end 12th gen intel motherboards can be flashed in the bios to take 13th gen cpus too  but do your research on those before going that route  this one will serve you well    
827,2023-09-22,5,60000,the United States,12700K,bought this for a new personal pc  my last was an i7 4790k build that got totaled out  crushed  during shipping  after building a new one on a z790i platform  the performance gain was stunning  completely night and day  i cannot say enough about this cpu  and would totally recommend this product  
828,2022-02-15,5,60000,the United States,12700K,it s been roughly 6 7 years since i last build my gaming computer  upgrading to this has been more than significant  as of this writing  i hope you ve done your research the i7 12700k s price point and its competition  for this price point  it may be the top dog   some things to consider before purchasing  1  make sure you are purchasing a lga 1700 motherboard  i went with the ddr4 motherboard because ddr5 is still at its infancy  the ddr5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now  you ll be fine with ddr4  2  this cpu does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor  double check if your psu will be enough  there are online resources that will help you calculate your psu  it s always good to have a little overhead  3  make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that s compatible with this motherboard  you can purchase them separately  if you have a heatsink that s very old   2016   it s more than likely it may not be compatible   good luck 
829,2022-08-04,5,60000,the United States,12700K,i had been planning to hold off for raptor lake  but my z370 mobo died  and i decided to go ahead and get an alder lake i7  so far it s impressive  it runs much cooler than my i9 9900k  mild oc    59c 63c under a gaming load vs 75c   but that could ve been due to the my old aio being in it s death throws for the past few months  3dmark cpu score went up noticeably as well  overall  i m pretty happy with it  haven t messed around with overclocking yet  but there doesn t seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be  from what i ve read 5 3 ghz is about what you can expect  the days of getting another 800mhz   1 ghz  over stock clocks out of a cpu are gone it seems 
830,2023-08-05,4,60000,the United States,12700K,i received the processor with the safety seal broken  so far everything works correctly but i did not like this to be like this
831,2023-12-09,5,60000,the United States,12700K,great product
832,2023-09-24,5,60000,the United States,12700K,paired it with an asus mobo and a lian li 360mm aio  runs cool  no performance issues  and no bottlenecks for the gaming i use it for 
833,2022-08-30,5,99999,India,12900K,i brought this processor for my gaming workstation build   combining this processor with nzxt 360 mm liquid cooling aio   things went smoothly  it can handle literally all heavy tasks like 3d rendering   simulation   gaming   yet keeps temprature at 40c   highly recommended for best gaming rigs   note  4th gen ssd is a plus for the build     otherwise there might be bottleneck with gen3 ssds while doing 3d rendering works  
834,2023-01-15,5,99999,India,12900K,was using amd cpu until now  cpu died in 2 year only  now back to intel  dad of amd  
835,2023-07-10,5,99999,Mexico,12900K,the difference in the change from amd to inter is feeling a lot  it is much more stable and more fluid  its drivers are well optimized and run spectacular  do not heat up  even 100  use is maintained in the 70 degrees
836,2024-02-26,5,99999,Germany,12900K,i sent it back because i have now changed my complete system  but the processor is great 
837,2024-02-14,5,99999,France,12900K,good
838,2023-04-28,5,99999,the United States,12900K,play video i recently got my hands on the intel core i9 12900k desktop processor  and i have to say  i am blown away by its performance  this processor is an absolute powerhouse  with 16 cores  8p 8e  and speeds of up to 5 2 ghz  it s also unlocked  which means i can push its limits even further if i want to   installing the processor was easy enough  although i did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the lga1700 socket and 600 series chipset  once i had everything set up  i fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform   the results were nothing short of impressive  the i9 12900k chewed through every task i threw at it with ease  from demanding video editing software to the latest aaa games  i was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns  and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy   the processor also runs surprisingly cool  even under heavy load  i did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor  but it s a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost   overall  i am extremely satisfied with the intel core i9 12900k desktop processor  if you re a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance  this processor is definitely worth considering  it s not cheap  but in my opinion  it s worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers 
839,2023-07-14,5,99999,Japan,12900K,i purchase this cpu 1 year ago and it cost me 74 000 jpy back then  the price didn t drop much since that time and the performance is satisfying so far   the new generation spec is higher so if you want to buy this cpu don t  instead  you can buy i7 gen13 as it will have the same spec plus a better cache than the 12 gen   it might be better to buy the k version in case you have issues with your gpu to troubleshoot 
840,2023-06-27,5,99999,Italy,12900K,really excellent processor in all on parts excellent seller who sent the processor 10 days before the expected deadline the processor arrived in its original packaging  perfectly sealed  which does not always happen compliments
841,2023-10-31,5,99999,Canada,12900K,this cpu has 24 threads and 16 cores  8e cores and 8p cores  which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issues  doesn t cause a cpu and gpu bottleneck as i only get about 45  gpu usage and stay under 10  load in most aaa titles like destiny or call of duty   cinebenchr23 benchmarks  using cinebench r23 i got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70   of top performing cpu score of 43640   using geek bench 6 test  i got a single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83   of top performing cpu score of 3097 and a multi core score of 12821 which is roughly 56   of top performing cpu score of 21742
842,2022-01-15,5,99999,Italy,12900K,finally intel remembered that it produces processors product undoubtedly at the top both as a price and as performance on 12900 and comuqnue a niche processor dedicated to the most extreme build or to those who really need great performances weaknesses consumption and temperatures another painful note lack of compatible or serious problems in finding the components to complete the pc laxing i highly recommend for the i 9 and the most estro phase a high  end or liquid air cooling 
843,2022-11-16,5,99999,France,12900K,without doubt one of the best processor of intel s rating the price is quite high but the power makes it feel  the passage on the ram ddr5 is in my opinion the best arguments of sale and a real advancement for my setup very practical for making twitch lives without having to lose fps in play 
844,2024-03-04,5,99999,Canada,12900K,this cpu has been put into my unraid server so i could take advantage of the onboard video for plex  my previous amd system i need a discrete graphics card to do the same thing  this new cpu worked perfectly for my use case 
845,2023-11-20,5,99999,Japan,12900K,very good
846,2022-06-04,5,99999,Japan,12900K,purchased in may 2022 operated by simple water cooling  rog240mm  of asus since the case is old  360mm is abandoned the cpu temperature can be maintained in the latter half of 80 ° c during the encoding of h 265 by rated use overclocking because it is z690 mother if it is up to 6 cores  it will go around with a magnification of 54 the temperature is about 90 ° c the voltage is  0 05v with offset in this case  the power consumption did not reach 241w by reading core temp however  the all  core is consumed to a magnification of 50 and it consumes up to nearly 300w and the cpu temperature is instantaneous to 100 ° c the thermal slot ring works immediately in each case  the room temperature is verified at 27 ° c i think that the temperature rising to 100 ° c in an instant can not be suppressed in an instant  so if you do not want to apply it to thermal slot ring  it will be difficult to overclock i thought if it is a single core  it is satisfied because it operates stable at 54 times it was replaced from 6700k  but when a 10  minute video was encoded to h 265  the 6700k ended in about 15 minutes and 12 900k ended in about 7 minutes i feel the change of the times even with premiere pro video editing  4k 8 streams   it did not become all core full power is it only when encoding and turning the bench certainly it generates heat  but it can be operated with 240mm simple water cooling if it is usually used 
847,2023-05-11,5,99999,the United States,12900K,this isn t the processor for everyone  but it is very fast  the individual cores aren t significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7  but if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you  i do software development  which it doesn t help 99  of the time  gaming  which it helps a little  and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music  during transcoding it helps a huge amount  i have over 300gb of flac audio files that i ripped from my cd collection  i never buy mp3s  i wanted to have that on my phone  but i didn t want to carry it at full rate because i can t tell the difference in the car  so i transcoded it  i had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old ryzen 7  this machine took around 30 minutes  30 40 times faster  at work the optics team  which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses  uses i9s in preference to xeons  the xeons might be faster under some circumstances  but the machines are hugely expensive  so the i9s are much better for price performance  would i buy it again  i d probably buy the 13th generation  but if i had any sense i d just get the 13th gen i7 
848,2022-08-15,5,99999,Germany,12900K,the price is bad
849,2023-12-01,5,99999,Canada,12900K,it s not the latest gen but an overclocked i9 12th gen is more than enough for almost any gaming  overclocked it does demand some serious cooling  but anyone who overclocks would expect that

851,2023-03-31,4,99999,Germany,12900K,everything is going well  but i need an invoice that i cannot apply for request for feedback
852,2022-10-14,5,99999,Canada,12900K,this thing never goes over 15 percent usage  and most games its actually using 0 4 percent  even on escape from tarkov at max settings 4k 140  fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0 1 percent  i don t know if it s my computer reading an error but i use a few apps to check including the task manager tab  i use an nzxt aio and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when i m gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s  i tried wow classic  retail  cyberpunk  spiderman   and regularly play escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage  my gpu barely works as i have a 3090 ti  my gpu is usually at usage 40 50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool  so i don t think anything is bottle necking   my old computer has an i5 and i have a laptop with an i7 and when i am gaming they are usually at 90  percent usage  even my friend with the amd 5800x3d was getting at least 30 percent usage for aaa games  this is the first computer i ve built where i m actually not even worried about the cpu for how cool it runs  i m really shocked on how good its performance is  definitely recommend 
853,2022-03-27,5,99999,Japan,12900K,if you do not give a strange load on a benchmark etc   it is not a hot cpu that is so hot  360 mm is ideal  but if you use it normal  it seems that you can go with 280 mm a calm case rises to 90 degrees or more without a hole  but i don t care because it is a perception that cpu does not have to exceed 100 degrees it is a cpu that is said to be a washer lake  but the processing is fast and it is not so hot because it is not so hot for normal use 
854,2022-04-06,5,99999,Japan,12900K,purchase for gaming pc  overclocks p core to 5 2ghz and regularly use it is a pretty good cpu if you can get along well with heat nevertheless  i haven t spent summer yet  so i m a little worried about it  but i m satisfied 
855,2024-03-03,5,99999,Canada,12900K,just a quick swap from a i5 to this on a 660 mobo noticed a difference right away in cities skylines 2 that s all i needed
856,2024-06-06,5,99999,the United States,12900K,make sure you have a good aio not an msi core liquid v2 360 because that one died on me and this was seeing 80 90c idle other than that this processor is pretty good when its cooled properly 
857,2023-01-22,4,99999,Japan,12900K,low binned cpu  bad cpu score
858,2024-03-20,5,99999,Canada,12900K,merci
859,2024-03-04,5,99999,the United States,12900K,works perfectly under load  work mostly on architecture and rendering
860,2024-01-06,5,99999,Canada,12900K,faster read  write speeds than i 7  easy install  i recommend a liquid cooler if you overclock  otherwise the revved fan noise will irritate you  i returned one  new unopened because the motherboard i ordered for it arrived damaged 
861,2022-04-06,1,99999,Japan,12900K,it arrived at 12900ks  not a product evaluation  but please be careful when shipping 
862,2024-04-24,5,99999,the United States,12900K,excellents processor  good price  i recommend the seller 100  
863,2023-08-10,5,99999,Canada,12900K,i ve only had it about a month  but so far it is complete overkill for gaming    i haven t seen it go above 50  pushing it as hard as i can other than stress testing lol  i bought it so hopefully in 10 years it can still do some stuff hahaha 
864,2024-05-11,4,99999,the United States,12900K,is 50c high  feels like it to me    under really heavy loads barley his 60  i have liquid cooling cpu   gpu aids and 9 fans  still seems high idk
865,2024-03-23,4,99999,the United States,12900K,well at the time of installing if i was a little fear but well everything went well you have to continue trying to see how it goes
866,2023-01-02,5,99999,the United States,12900K,so far this thing is great  i upgraded from the 9900k and this has been a noticeable difference  i m still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software  i haven t done any overclocking so the cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings  after seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get i added the thermalright contact frame  it was a breeze to install  i watched the gamer s nexus video about this frame and followed their directions  for the motherboard i went with a msi z690 mpg edge wifi ddr4 so i could reuse my current ram  i had to order a lga 1700 bracket for the nzxt kraken x73 aio  i ordered both the frame and the lga 1700 mount from amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what i needed  so far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900k  i m planning to do a little gaming this week with it so i ll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use  i also do a bit of premiere and after effects so i m looking forward to seeing how it works there as well  overall  this is probably way more processor than i need  i was still able to do what i needed to do with the 9900k  i built the 9900k in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high pc price wave  i ended up getting this processor for about  100 less than i paid for the 9900k two years ago  so the price to performance upgrade for me was a no brainer  if you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price  this is a great one to get  just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling 
867,2024-03-19,5,99999,the United States,12900K,quality and price
868,2023-11-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,it took me less than 15 minutes to take out my current 1700 series cpu  i7 12700k  and add in this new one  removed the aio cooler  cleaned off the thermal paste  applied new past after inserting and wala  it s up and running like a champ  i m not a gamer  so yes i understand it s not a huge bump in performance for those applications  video editing is another story 
869,2023-09-11,5,99999,the United States,12900K,are usually go for the best products and it was a mistake for my first pc build i chose this chip and i didn’t know it runs that hot i built my pc i had enough fans but i had a 240 mm radiator i want a micro center and had to get a 360 mm cooler from the pool  the temps were at 89 to 92°c after the deep cool aio under stress  test and bench testing the temp stay under 60°c   other than that i game hard on it and stream and the cpu usage never goes past 30   it’s pretty overkill but that’s how i like my pc 
870,2023-08-07,5,99999,the United States,12900K,purchased this for my new rig as opposed to an i7 based on price point at time of purchase  this was actually cheaper than the i7   paired with rtx 4060ti 8gb   no regrets  this can handle anything i throw at it  without issue  gaming wise  and never goes above 50 55c  not overclocked and cooled with 240mm aio from corsair  idles around 32 33c very responsive with plenty of clearance if i ever want to oc this guy  heat was a concern after reading reviews and only having a 240mm radiator  sitting over a 4060ti   but no issues   heat or performance  at all   great time to buy with new gen just arriving recently 
871,2022-02-21,5,99999,the United States,12900K,purchased this cpu to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that i have had for close to 4 years now  and considering i also own a 3090 i was lucky enough to get last year  it was time  paired with said gpu and a msi tomahawk z690 with a noctua nh d15 chromax black cooler  this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k  certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like discord would introduce very bad stutter  however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k  temps are high when im doing full resolution photo renders from my dji air 2s or sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking  but that is expected and i m not one to sweat about 80 90c temps  but if you are i would recommend the 12700k 5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage  however in gaming with multiple different firefox tabs and discord telegram open  it never even touches 70c  so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing  make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well  as my system can suck north of 600 750w full tilt  my power supply being a 1200w platinum evga that doesnt break a sweat under full load  
872,2024-01-04,5,99999,the United States,12900K,if someone ever asks you  what is a gpu bottleneck  buy them a 12900k lmao   it s so good 
873,2023-11-02,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i love the intel i9 unlocked processor  i have always used intel and will continue to do so  all of my games operate smoothly  the graphics are amazing used with the correct moniter and gpu  in my opinion intel beats ryzen hands down 
874,2023-07-18,4,99999,the United States,12900K,came packaged kinda poorly  and didn’t include the golden coin case  which makes me think maybe it was pre owned  when i opened the packaging though it had no paste on it and the pins looked brand new  so maybe they just don’t include it anymore since it isn’t the newest flag ship  
875,2023-11-17,5,99999,the United States,12900K,the cpu run fast and stays cool  the performance was great  test run at 5 2ghz the temperature not over heat run with my solidworks software that cpu was great 
876,2023-08-14,5,99999,the United States,12900K,using this to serve movies and shows using plex  handles continuous recording of several 4k surveillance cameras using blue iris  runs a web server  just for family   and controls a z wave home automation program involving several nodes  i also use it listen to my collection of music  it does all of these tasks  along with other minor things  without a sweat  generally it keeps under 15  utilization  thank you intel 
877,2022-01-10,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i only used laptops up to this point and this is my first pc build however i got this processor specifically for workstation class computation and high performance gaming  the core i9 12900k is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65w 80w in the games i have played so far  it renders 3d projects at such a speed i hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace  i would say the core i5 12600k is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming  i highly recommend this processor or anything in the 12th gen alder lake family   full system specs  ・asus prime z690 a ・noctua nh d15 chromax black ・intel core i9 12900k 5 2ghz ・nvidia rtx a5000 24gb ecc ・g skill trident z5 rgb 32gb 5600mhz ・samsung 980 pro 2tb m 2 nvme ・samsung 970 evo plus 2tb m 2 nvme ・samsung 970 evo plus 2tb m 2 nvme ・samsung 970 evo plus 2tb m 2 nvme ・evga super nova g5 850w 80 plus gold ・fractal torrent gray e atx mid tower case
878,2023-11-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,if you want to play a little and do professional things  this would be indicated by the distribution of nuclei it has 
879,2022-08-23,4,99999,the United States,12900K,i bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores  there is a price difference to consider  as many know  more cores doesn t necessarily mean better  games only use a max of 6 cores  though it may vary from game to game  if you just want to game  buy the i7 series  my 4790k had served me so well  it s still my backup on my old mobo  it s been at least 5 years since i bought ol  reliable  she s been through rough seas  it was time for her to rest easy   for the i9  in terms of gaming performance  only cpu heavy games like rts games will see any benefit  multi tasking also sees benefit  though that s limited to the hard drive it s working off of  still  i expect great things in the far future   the packaging is a keeper to be sure  too 
880,2023-05-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,it s great  i m using 13900k but wanted a better cpu for my 2nd pc  and it s great  especially for compute tasks and multi threaded workloads  the raptor lake  and forthcoming  will of course be better  but if you need the best alder lake cpu and can find a decent deal  it won t let you down  i m able to cool it efficiently with a noctua n 14  single stack  single fan setup  and it works great 
881,2023-10-13,5,99999,the United States,12900K,bought on sale  my rig placed in the 97 percentile  the pc is overclocked  the processor is running cool and stable  no issues yet  would recommend
882,2023-12-07,5,99999,the United States,12900K,well packed and new 
883,2023-09-25,5,99999,the United States,12900K,this cpu is top quality  it is easy to install and works great for gaming  it stays cool and i have had no problems with it 
884,2023-10-05,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i bought it with price lower than i7 13700  which was very good choice and happy with the decision
885,2023-09-15,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i was going to go for the 13900k but i took this one for half of the price and have to tell u love it thank you
886,2023-07-09,5,99999,the United States,12900K,it s been less then 24hrs since i upgraded from an i7 8700 and could instantly tell a difference in performance  haven t had the need to overclock since it handles streaming on twitch kick with obs while playing games on the same pc very nicely at stock settings 
887,2022-07-21,4,99999,the United States,12900K,the 12900k can be hard to justify  the 12700k is around two thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent  furthermore  you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more  even while using the nh d15 cpu cooler i decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check  bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k  given the option to do it over  i would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about  250 
888,2023-04-29,5,99999,the United States,12900K,many cores  able to run multiple virtual machines with unnoticeable slowdown to other functions  stays at 1 3  when playing games paired with a 3070  may upgrade to 13th gen later  but i really can t complain in terms of performance  only have a dualfan dual heatsink cpu cooler and it stays below 60 celsius at all times  rests at about 30 
889,2023-10-24,5,99999,the United States,12900K,fast shipping and great product
890,2023-04-19,5,99999,the United States,12900K,this cpu is power hungry under load but in games the cpu is fast  this also works fine for workstation workloads but this shines in gaming for sure  also if you have the cooling this cpu can be clocked even higher for better performance  but for this you will need a decent cpu cooler 
891,2021-12-16,1,99999,the United States,12900K,i ve put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast cpu   unfortunately this one i ordered from amazon came already opened  as soon as i opened the shipping box i could tell it had been opened before  the edge was uneven and the label crease was loose  i put my x acto knife down  which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason  and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal   if i hadn t opened a few of them already with intel s fancy new packaging i probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is  it is very precise  tight  even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry   my biggest fear was there wasn t going to be a cpu in there at all but luckily the right cpu was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new i don t do open boxes   make sure to check your packages before opening  the seal should be nice and tight and straight  the edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line edges should be even and exacting   give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn t been altered or tampered with  it should be very firm and unable to just pull open easily  look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside   fresh  brand new i9 12900k s are very pristine and boxed with precision   still  they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen 
892,2023-09-27,5,99999,the United States,12900K,great price easy to install
893,2022-08-22,5,99999,the United States,12900K,now has a thin film over it  don’t know how it receives electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard  probably similar to wireless charging  but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while handling the cpu during the build  after all cpu is the most or second mot expensive component in a pc build   other than that  the increase in core count and speed  couple with gen 4 ssd and rtx 3090 ti  everything else is just slow
894,2022-10-19,5,99999,the United States,12900K,received at least a week earlier than the scheduled assessment for delivery  not installed yet but if you look at video reviews i m sure you know this processor is going to preform when you need it as a creator  at the moment i m still using a 2010 year  i7 that endured the test of time in a properly built computer  now it s time for the i9 12900k lga1700 creator build computer to handle photography   video production in 2022 
895,2023-10-03,5,99999,the United States,12900K,good
896,2023-05-30,5,99999,the United States,12900K,this unit is powerful for all of your needs  just remember this thing runs really hot    make sure you use a good cooling system  otherwise  you will have thermal throttling issues 
897,2023-10-16,3,99999,the United States,12900K,i bought this thinking it came with the whole case and everything but it came in a cheap little box that was half crushed 
898,2023-03-23,5,99999,the United States,12900K,this is the fastest processor i ve ever owned and with it i upgraded my entire pc  even though i purchased last years model it s still extremely fast and works well   make sure you pair this with a good motherboard otherwise it can run pretty hot 
899,2023-07-10,5,99999,the United States,12900K,could is great but  boy does she put off some heat  feels like a furnace under my desk
900,2023-03-25,5,99999,the United States,12900K,this cpu is killer and can literally handle any game you throw at it on max settings  and the same can be said for most workload programs  however i bought it back in early 2022  when it was still way overpriced for what it is now
901,2023-07-18,5,99999,the United States,12900K,really fast for gaming  excellent speeds  intel driver software is nice too 
902,2023-08-24,5,99999,the United States,12900K,it arrived excellent and without problems 100  recommended
903,2023-09-10,5,99999,the United States,12900K,great processor
904,2022-09-12,5,99999,the United States,12900K,awesome cpu blazzzing fast        for gaming and other tasks   i see that the temps for this cpu work up into the 70 s and even higher 80   my recommendation is to undervote your cpu if your just gaming that will lower temps  with good thermal paste kingpin cooling kpx and a water cooler im getting 55 58c in gaming hope it helps 
905,2023-06-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,not sure if i bought the best in terms of value and performance 
906,2023-08-15,5,99999,the United States,12900K,supper fast works just grate
907,2023-08-09,5,99999,the United States,12900K,thanks i get fast and good performance
908,2023-06-01,5,99999,the United States,12900K,powerful  speed  great performance     really a great wonder what this processor does 
909,2023-02-27,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i found this on sale for  350  a 12th gen i9 for a comparable price to an i7 i mean the review writes itself couldn’t have been more excited to get such a great cpu for such a competitive price 
910,2022-07-21,5,99999,the United States,12900K,the processor is amazing  upgraded from an intel 8700k  paired it with 6400 mhz ddr5 memory on a asrock z690 taichi motherboard and my nvidia evga 3080ti and i m consistently in the top 5  of benchmarks world wide with barely any tweeks except selecting the xmp profile in my bios  blows away anything currently amd is offering in the same price range 
911,2022-12-16,4,99999,the United States,12900K,very excited to get up and running  came in og box sealed  took a long time to get but very pleased
912,2022-10-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,there s nothing more to say  if you only want gaming get an i7  unless you re into emulation that s the only instance where you ll get an actual edge it runs pretttty hot as it takes over 250 watts if it can  in my case over 270 so keep that in mind
913,2022-06-11,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i had been working with xeon for 10 years  and i have to clarify that they have been excellent and durable processors  but i needed to update a processor that was faster and i have taken the rightner with this i9 work in design in general  video edition  animation and 3d  where there is a benefit thanks to its power  everything moves as butter 
914,2023-04-01,5,99999,the United States,12900K,this was a huge upgrade to my system for good price  im back into the modern pc world  win 11 runs great
915,2022-04-06,4,99999,the United States,12900K,the processor is excellent and its performance does not let it desire if you doubt one of the best processors today however  at maximum load it is difficult to refrigerate and has very high energy consumption  but in the rest of the applications consumption is usually very low and maintains good temperatures
916,2022-09-07,5,99999,the United States,12900K,this thing is truly impressive  it also comes in a very shiny golden container  it makes you happy the moment you open the package  as far as i have researched this is the absolute best and most powerful processor on the market as or 9 6 2022  i definitely recommend 
917,2022-02-18,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i love this processor  it can handle anything i throw at it  the only thing i was concerned with  is that i bought it  new   but the stickers were peeled off the intel 12900k box  so i am not sure what was up with that  it looked like it still had the safety seal on it though  but at least it works 
918,2022-11-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,it will handle all your multitasking needs with ease  even while gaming  only con i can think of is that it does run very hot so you ll need a high end cooler to get the best performance
919,2022-09-09,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i m very satisfied with this processor  i ve used intel for many years now and i ve never had any problems with them  looking back when i first started computer gaming  i was gaming on a 386 dx66 that i bought from mongomery wards   lol  
920,2022-12-21,5,99999,the United States,12900K,i absolutely love the gold packaging this came in  the product works as intended and it s worth every penny considering how much cheaper it is than the msrp

931,2023-09-04,1,52743,Belgium,13500,a room was missing in the box
932,2024-04-22,5,28999,Canada,13400F,hello   so i bought this processor to replace my ryzen 7 2700x that finally decided to die on me  i have had the ryzen since launch   i was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better  however  this i5 13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen  it also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out  my ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load  the i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land  that s 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load   with that said that s a huge improvement over my old ryzen  which i shouldn t be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now  but damn  definitely worth grabbing one   my old ryzen would get bogged down if i created a video game asset in blender around if i went too crazy  so far the i5 hasn t been bothered by anything i do in blender  or in zbrush  maya  3ds max  or substance painter 
933,2023-10-17,5,52743,Spain,13500,i bought the i5 13500 due to the good comments since for the video edition i would be phenomenal i have installed it on an asus rog strig b660 f wifi plate  two nvme m2   kinston and crucial   corsair memory of 6000 mh the plate  after the cold update of the bios accepted the g3 processor  the memora  after activating the bios tab  works at 6000 mh without problem as i said  i bought it for video edition  i have been doing a test with the integrated graph   i have not yet placed the dedicated one  i have been a pleasant surprise  because with this configuration without integrated graphics  i created a 15  minute video  without tracing or anything   it was a test   the raw video  after 3 or 4 minutes  video finished when with myold i7 took half an hour to 45 minutes  i am talking about a 1920x1080 resolution i mean  you can with it maybe it also has something to do with the editing program that is not of the pointers that everyone names  but that is fantastic and does the same i ve been using the magix edition program for a long time  if my old pc could  this one owed much more  as it has been  since the program itself does not require so many resources for now very happy i have it with the dissipator that everyone hates   the one of origin  that comes next to the processor when you edit every pill i will see if it is heated or not  for the moment not i simply want to give a pull of ear to whom it corresponds since the box arrived despised and for criticizing it  amazón has not published two reviews prior to the assembly of the same i forgot  i have mounted the processor with the suggestion plate that is sold apart and ensures the four  screw processor to prevent double i recommend it 100  since it is to enjoy with this configuration 
934,2024-04-03,5,28999,Japan,13400F,it works stably 
935,2023-06-21,5,28999,Mexico,13400F,i bought it to play video games and i am quite satisfied  i run all the games in ultra without problems at 60fps stable  i have a 3060ti  it is definitely worth having the 13th generation once so that the useful life of the pc is a bitlonger
936,2024-03-20,5,52743,the United States,13500,this cpu was a no brainer for a budget gaming pc  works well and was super easy to install in my asrock z690 rs 
937,2024-04-14,5,52743,Canada,13500,20 threads  30w idle  what else you need   great cpu for proxmox sever  tons of power 
938,2023-08-30,5,20250,Canada,13100,for the price
939,2024-05-25,5,28999,the United States,13400F,wow this thing is fast  intel has done an amazing job with the 13th gen  i m using it on my dev machine and the vs code   node js   react environment starts up lightning fast  and with 6 4 cores  there s plenty of room left for background tasks  docker containers    and i m still amazed at how affordable such a powerhouse processor is  i literally don t need to go i7 or i9  love the competition amd and intel are still having and am happy to have a processor split household   
940,2024-03-08,5,52743,Japan,13500,transfer from 4690k the cooler uses ak500 it is the best because it can maintain 4ghz even with a full load there is also a improvement in the undercarriage of memory and ssd  but the experience has become quite crisp even though it is in the late 30 000 yen range  this is a middle class is a great era i think it s still enough to buy  but in the future there is a flow that incorporates the npu circuit  so if you anticipate that the local processing ai  based app will be common  the npu will enter the desktop several generations later i think that if you buy a model of  you can use it for a long time 
941,2023-09-13,5,28999,the United Kingdom,13400F,great performance on a budget  great core for a 1080p 2k gaming machine  easy to install and no issues with operation 
942,2023-12-21,2,52743,Spain,13500,the product well  the disastrous amazon service  does not want to return the customs expenses that retained me in the purchase and then their carrier  emails  has made me pay those expenses  the office to give me the products i have been stolen from amazón
943,2024-05-21,5,28999,Canada,13400F,paired it with a rtx 3070 and handles everything very well  40  utilization with full load of gpu  also great for productivity with 10 cpu cores 
944,2023-09-14,5,20250,the United States,13100,i build pcs for clients daily  the core i3 13100 is absolutely perfect  6 core 12 thread  nothing can beat it for the money  and the client is very happy with its performance  can run many different programs at once   the core i3 has changed alot over the years  used to be dual core  with ht  then quad core not ht  now 6 core 12 thread  much better value  maybe for the 14th gen core i3 they could include 6 p cores  2 e cores  being the same 12 thread cpu 
945,2023-09-15,5,52743,France,13500,good product
946,2024-04-11,4,52743,Japan,13500,it was very useful to explain how to attach to the motherboard with illustrations 
947,2024-05-02,5,28999,the United States,13400F,this cpu is more than enough for any mid low end pc build and will play well at any game  including aaa games  in fact i think you can definitely save money and go for the 12400f in terms of bang for buck  loving this cpu and fixed my bottleneck
948,2023-05-13,5,20250,the United States,13100,if you need more processor  buy more processor  however  most web surfer and video viewers will never notice this is a budget cpu  modern tech makes this little guys speedy as heck  it runs games just fine as long as your expectations are super high end 4k gaming at a zillion fps  check youtube for videos  great little chip 
949,2024-06-03,4,28999,Japan,13400F,i am very happy to be able to buy what i wanted at a low price the product is also used and can be used without any problems 
950,2024-03-30,5,28999,Canada,13400F,this thing is still rated in the top for gaming processors and has served me well over the past few months  upgrading my video card now to take advantage of this better as it s creating a bottle neck  handles vr games like a charm and doesn t struggle with anything i ve thrown at it 
951,2023-10-27,5,52743,Canada,13500,plenty fast enough for me  i do some gaming  war thunder  cities skylines  company of heroes  and some stable diffusion ai artwork and this handles everything   the integrated cooler is small and handles the heat fine  without having to worry about paying for elaborate cooling solutions 
952,2024-01-31,5,52743,the United States,13500,the box contained everything i needed to install the processor  it was super easy to install the process in the new build i did  and everything went perfectly  i am not a performance fiend  so i cannot comment on the performance 
953,2023-09-28,5,28999,Mexico,13400F,i get faster than tofo expected in order and well protected at a very good price
954,2024-03-30,5,28999,Canada,13400F,bought this to replace a burned out chip on my old motherboard  install was easy  so long as you know what you are doing  and only took a few minutes to get my computer up and running again 
955,2023-07-13,4,20250,the United States,13100,the 13100 isn t the powerhouse that the 13900k is  but it works well for day to day task where a more powerful processor isn t required 
956,2023-08-05,5,52743,Japan,13500,i was surprised to see 60fps in the cpu encoding of 1080p video in aviutl x265 compared to other pcs with the same encoding settings     core 2 quad q8200 is 5fps  sse4 era without avx command  celeon n4100 is 5fps  4 core atom ≒ core 2 quad law  ryzen 5 3500u is 7fps zen avx256 is internally a 128  bit processing equivalent to sse4  ryzen 5 pro 3400ge is 17fps  i guess it is the same as sandy bridge  core i7 4770 is 20fps  faster than zen  so a sense of outdatedryzne 5 5500u is 25fps  zen2  6 cores of model number fraud  but only 2 5ghz  core i5 1135g7 is 30fps  avx512 compatible with 4 cores 5750ge is captured for those who do not know sse avx  zen3 is not avx512 and is slow for 8 cores  sse avx  so  called simd instruction  is a technology in which the cpu operator  recently 256 to 512 bits  is subdivided according to the variable type  8 64bit   and the calculation is parallel avx256 calculates 8  bit variables in 32 parallel  but avx512 can calculate in 64 parallel the recent performance of the cpu is almost determined by the speed of the avx instruction in particular  the speed of the video encoding and generated ai appears in the superiority of the avx instruction intel has a fast avx order since haswell refresh  4th generation   and is strong in video conversion  and when idle is about 700mhz  ryzen is about 1 4ghz at most   it is good to have high power saving performance hey however  if the power limit does not work at all  it will have a hard time cooling the cpu cooler for tdp65w drops to about 3 0ghz with the thermal slot ring still  it is a big deal because the above performance comes out if you attach a fine cpu cooler  it will always move around 4 0ghz this is the second generation of p core  single performance specialization  and e core  efficiency   multi performance   which are good at intel  who makes a wide range of cpus from atom to xeon the production process  nm value  tends to be delayed to amd and arm  but i think intel is still excellent in architecture and instruction sets if you switch from the tiger lake  11th generation  below  the performance is not a dream  so you are amazed at the advancement of technology the built  in gpu is 32 executed units  80 i5 1135g7 of tiger lake   so it should be divisible as a bonus if you are willing to play a little game  add the video card however  it is convenient to be able to output a monitor without a video card recently  even the i5 costs 35 000 yen due to the depreciation of the yen in the past  i could buy i7 at the same price 。。recently  the discount mazabo of about 5 000 yen is gone  and it is cheap and costs 15 000 yen  so it is a 50 000 yen course with cpu mazabo alone 。。i still think i did a good shopping  2023 10 29 postscript  as a result of replacing the cpu cooler and stopping tdp65w    i think that it is inevitable because it is a real oc ignoring the power limit of a 65w rated 65w  but if you use the tdp125w settings in gigabyte b760m ds3h ddr4  the cpu voltage exceeded 1 4v the operation becomes unstable from around it will be stable if you use it at about 1 3v cpu voltage set with tdp100w it seems better not to use it in mazabo that wants to use the cpu voltage 
957,2024-01-22,1,52743,Canada,13500,intel chip arrived open  used with wear marks from being installed and traces of thermal paste  not what i expected  unimpressed
958,2023-07-26,4,28999,Mexico,13400F,the product more specifically the processor came well  the processor only  but when i opened the processor box  to assemble my pc   the fan that came with it was broken  but luckily i did not worry  because i had a liquid refigration that already alreadyi had bought and i did not stop to ask for guarantee  because i was only interested in the processor 
959,2024-03-27,5,28999,Japan,13400F,the operation is crisp after changing from ryzen to intel recommended cpu for beginners
960,2023-09-18,5,52743,the United States,13500,i just assembled a new computer using this processor on a gigabyte b760 with ddr5 memory  the system came up without a hitch and the bios screen appeared very professional  i installed ubuntu 22 04  the only thing i noticed was a hang when installing 22 04 1  so i had to initially select safe mode  i recommend using 22 04 3  current  because it probably fixes that issue  with 20 cores total this processor is just a downgraded i5 13600k  i don t overclock anyways so it fits my needs  ram and the sleep function work perfectly  i had trouble with the competitor s 
961,2023-10-28,5,28999,Mexico,13400F,excellent cpu for games  supports gpu high ranges
962,2023-03-26,5,20250,the United States,13100,used it in a fresh build on msi mortar wifi and thermalright assassin x  temps 3x on idle and 5x on load  has all needed performance and with integrated graphics is all needed  with gigabyte eagle rtx 3060 oc got fortnite epic run 130fps  1080p and  90fps  1440p  black mesa ultra  1440p got 100 200fps  single con  could be better priced around 130 though  i decided to have this configuration to have the possibilty to upgrade to 13600k sometime later if needed for graphics render software 
963,2024-03-25,5,28999,Canada,13400F,upgrade from i5 7400 to this  it s night and day 
964,2023-12-01,5,52743,the United States,13500,this thing performs neck and neck with an i7 12700k at half the power draw  with half the heat  it has become my new go to for sub  1000 client gaming system builds  pairs great with any gpu up to an rtx 4070 or an rx 7800 xt
965,2023-11-18,5,28999,the United States,13400F,so i was stuck on windows 10 with my lga 1151 core i7 6700  this processor at an affordable price more than doubled  maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older ddr4 3200 ram and m 2 storage  also allows me to update my machine to windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu  i considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support  but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration  i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new matx board and this cpu  the only complaint i have is the cpu box was clearly opened and i am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else s board at some point and returned  i don t like that when the product is being advertised as new  the seller was amazon llc too so i am not sure what is going on with that  i have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so i really don t want to pack it up and ship it back  my chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan  3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71c but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100  utilization  at idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30 35c with the fan running somewhere around 40   all in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for win 11  will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good gpu 
966,2024-01-26,5,28999,Japan,13400F,until now  6 core 12 threads were the best cpu  but when i purchased it  the cpu with a 10  core 16 thread was clearly found i think the challenge is how to make use of this cpu from now on i don t play much games 
967,2024-02-14,4,28999,the United States,13400F,i was having issues with a new build where i wasn t able to adjust any of my fan speeds  the included fan was not spinning faster than about 600 rpm and luckily the processor throttled itself at 100c to prevent death  after taking the fan off and powering it separately it spun up to 3000rpm  i noticed that the wires were pinched along the heatsink because the housing was screwed down too tight  it happens  after fixing it and screwing it back on  not as tight  everything seems to be working  if the cpu wasn t throttling it would have died because of a tiny mistake in the fan wiring go figure 
968,2024-01-16,5,52743,Japan,13500,the core i5 13500 has high performance and excellent processing power the 14nm process technology has been adopted  and the clock speed has been improved to up to 4 80ghz as a result  smooth operation can be expected even in multitasking processing and high  load applications in addition to improving performance  power saving design is also evolving  improving energy efficiency as a result  comfortable use in low power state because of its excellent performance for the price  it can be said that it is an excellent option in terms of cost it supports a wide range of applications  such as games  creative work  and general office use  and is recommended for users who want to improve computer performance 
969,2023-07-23,5,28999,Mexico,13400F,it is the fair processor  good performance for most current applications to an excellent price  it works for gamer or productivity assembly  recommended   
970,2024-06-08,5,52743,the United States,13500,by default it may not boost to its marketing frequency  i had to increase power limit in motherboard settings 
971,2023-07-09,5,20250,the United States,13100,the youngest of his family and defends himself very well  is perfect with an rtx 3060 12gb and everything in ultra
972,2023-10-28,4,52743,Japan,13500,intel is the best  since it is a sales and shipping of a certain famous parts shop  there is no such thing as it has been opened and only the cpu is not included 
973,2024-06-07,5,52743,the United States,13500,excellent product
974,2024-03-11,5,28999,Canada,13400F,work wonderfully thank you
975,2024-04-26,5,28999,the United States,13400F,i upgraded from an i7 7700k to this and its amazing  perfect for gaming and stays cool  i have no issues or complaints what so ever 
976,2023-07-10,5,20250,the United States,13100,all i can say is that i m very happy with my purchase 
977,2024-05-09,5,52743,the United States,13500,processor with very good performance  when performing heavy tasks it behaves very well good performance 
978,2024-01-26,5,52743,Japan,13500,it costs less than 40 000 yen  and the 14 cores and 20 threads are good cospa 
979,2024-01-02,5,28999,Canada,13400F,couldn t recommend more for gaming  plenty of head room on the titles i enjoy  10 cores in total being plenty for most games  with applications running in the background like streaming and playing music 
980,2024-05-31,5,28999,the United States,13400F,yields as expected both to play and to work
981,2024-05-02,5,28999,the United States,13400F,my son needed this to build his pc gaming system  perfect 
982,2024-06-14,5,52743,the United States,13500,play video it works as intended 10 10
983,2024-04-23,3,28999,the United States,13400F,got this for a homemade nas   file server  motherboard manufacturers will make this chips run at limit spec  when all you may want is completely opposite  running low power to save a bit on the electricity bill   get it on a sale is worth it  more than 150 is not 
984,2024-02-28,5,52743,the United States,13500,does everything i need it to do and then some  all while drawing less than 100 watts 
985,2024-02-25,4,28999,Japan,13400F,even if you buy a high gravo  the cpu may pull your feet for cospa 
986,2023-12-07,5,28999,the United States,13400F,im suuuuuper new to building pc s so it was my first time ever doing this  very easy to figure how it goes into the motherboard with these little arrows on the corner  and also it is realllyy powerful for what it is it can handle all the way up to the 4070 ti which is verrry good
987,2024-01-04,5,28999,the United States,13400F,excellent recommended full processor worked perfectly in my low  end armed 
988,2024-01-03,5,28999,the United States,13400F,lego all good and works optimated  thank you 
989,2023-10-10,5,52743,the United States,13500,it works better than i expected although i do not have a graphics card the integrated one works very well in games like valorant but when using it in war zone 2 the graph is needed to install it in an asus z690 a wifi 32gb of ram
990,2023-12-12,5,28999,the United States,13400F,good protection and care of the article  i recommend it 
991,2023-09-28,5,28999,the United States,13400F,no issues with the speed but the stock cooler is no good in some more new games but other than that an exelent processor for mid range pc 
992,2023-03-05,4,52743,the United States,13500,i was extremely excited to install this i5 13500 cpu in asrock z790 taichi motherboard  i did notice an improvement over 13400  but unfortunately games started to stutter  i don t know what is the reason  all of my drivers are updated  graphics card is rtx 4080  i went back to 13400 and everything runs great  i cannot recommend 13500 for a gaming setup  but it really shines with web browsing and productivity 
993,2023-10-28,5,52743,the United States,13500,i bought it for its ability to transcode video files and it is working great 
994,2024-01-05,5,28999,Canada,13400F,i like it
995,2023-09-19,5,28999,the United States,13400F,for the price this is an amazing mid to high range cpu  i’ve had this for a few weeks now and it works great 
996,2023-08-13,5,28999,the United States,13400F,this really handles gaming well  look up bottle neck calculator online…  match it with some gpus you may be quite surprised of what it is capable of  works great with my rtx3080  yea i like it    
997,2023-09-25,5,52743,the United States,13500,this is the ideal choice for tight quarter itx builds  it is easily cooled  i’m running it in the fractal ridge 
998,2023-06-23,4,52743,the United States,13500,pretty fast for gaming and day to day tasks  it gets very hot so you need decent cooling

1001,2023-08-20,5,52743,the United States,13500,very satisfied with how fast it is  i am surprised by its ability to open applications and process data  and everything in relation to its price is very good
1002,2023-04-14,4,52743,the United States,13500,pro  fast cons  vmware esxi didn’t support e core  that means it can only p core x12 core  or use 6 p core   8 e core 
1003,2023-08-08,5,28999,the United States,13400F,running smoothly i have used it with 1080ti  playing high configuration requirements pc games for several months and it works great  it’s not expensive  very worth 
1004,2023-03-13,5,27500,India,13400F,good condition and working properly
1005,2024-04-23,5,27500,Spain,13400F,a quick processor in all institute tasks such as powerpoint excel canvas with a 7800xt bottlene
1006,2023-09-30,5,27500,France,13400F,the intel core i5 13400f processor offers solid performance with excellent value for money 1     performances     the performance of the i5 13400f are impressive  offering a rapid and effective treatment power for daily tasks and games 2     architecture     based on the architecture alder lake  this processor benefits from the latest technological advances  guaranteeing increased energy efficiency and optimized performance 3     multitage     multitage management is robust thanks to its six cores and twelve threads  allowing fluid execution of several simultaneous applications 4     game     the performances in play are convincing  offering stable image frequencies in a wide range of titles  making a solid choice for players on a budget 5     cooling     moderate energy consumption contributes to relatively fresh operation  although the addition of an effective cooling system can further optimize performance 6     value for money     the i5 13400f offers excellent value for money  ideal for users seeking competitive performance without exploding their budget in summary  the intel core i5 13400f processor represents a balanced choice for those looking for reliable performance at a reasonable cost  placing it as a competitor of choice on the mid range processors 
1007,2024-04-05,5,27500,Italy,13400F,even being the i5 smaller does its duty very well never a problem or a block despite having its stock digger i use it for productivity and some small game advised
1008,2023-04-05,5,27500,Poland,13400F,the processor is very strong  it will handle it calmly for years transfer from the 5th generation of intel to 13    the processor came in the oem version  but the service gave me a discount on the purchase of cooling  so i m happy the warranty is 2 years  so it s ok 
1009,2024-06-12,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,very strong processor  pushes from the quiet rtx 4060 to the limit 
1010,2024-04-19,5,27500,Belgium,13400F,very happy with delivery and product
1011,2023-06-11,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,i was looking to upgrade my 10 year old dell system to make it compatible with windows  this cpu stood out as it had a lot of cores  good speed specification and without the on board gpu it was a good price  the supplied intel cooling fan is very good  overall a good purchase 
1012,2024-04-23,5,27500,Australia,13400F,bang for the buck 
1013,2024-03-09,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,this cpu is well priced and very fast for the price  very happy customer indeed  highly recommended 
1014,2024-05-23,5,27500,France,13400F,this processor is very fast perfect no complaints 
1015,2023-04-29,1,27500,the Netherlands,13400F,this is my first bad experience with the i5 x400f series  tried it on a fairly decent msi z790 tomahawk motherboard  i tried the i5 8400  10400f  11400f and now this 13400f  and this is the first one that dissapoints  the turboboost behavior is not what i m used to  i do not recommend this one  the performance overall is better then the older ones ofcourse  but the powerlimits and frequencies are all over the place  and not how it should be on paper  max turbo power should be 143watts and all core turbo 4 1ghz   my sample s all core turbo didn t go above 3 9ghz and the power draw didn t went above 80 watts  and that s lower then previous gens  therefore it s underperforming  weird behavior on this chip  returned it 
1016,2023-06-20,5,27500,Germany,13400F,i bought this processor due to its price performance ratio because i wanted to upgrade my system the packaging is simple  no irrelevant information and has an appealing effect on me the processor was added with a boxed cooler  i e  directly with a suitable air cooler using the mainboard is very simple and the feel is very appealing as always  the product name and the clock frequency is shown on the processor the cpu has no real competition in its price field that have similar services the price is also very appropriate above all  i like the division of the processor cores  which also fulfills the tasks of the pc separately that the maximum performance has also taken out the processor has no graphics unit due to the  f marking the frequency of the processor is quite high and also offers a very satisfactory performance i only get the cpu on half of the utilization under very difficult conditions my only criticism here is the air cooler the cpu does not get too hot with it  but it is quite loud and because of it i would better advise another air cooler or even more overall  a very good and recommended product 
1017,2024-03-26,5,27500,Italy,13400F,i am now trying that i write this review  i find that it is as required as its predecessor  the 12400f  with 100mhz more that they are not even perceived  perhaps with the architecture a little improved it seems more reactive to me  but it is a feeling probably data in hand we are there like the 12400f with 4 more ecore that probably in the productive environment give that pinch of more calculation that does not hurt so 10 cores and 16 threads with a 4ghz in gaming clock is very good as always very armored  it has not unlocked  only the frequencies of the ram can be adjusted  the processor is and that remains  in this intel unfortunately it has always been very tirchy  either take the k series or do not change even a comma apart from this philosophical commercial choice  this processor goes that is a fairy tale  with a 3070 it turns well for us a little and for that handful of watt that consumes it does not warm up even much i took it in a moment at offera for € 180 and i believe that in the near future it will give these figures  for a gaming pc  so to speak  entry level  at that price is a good deal 
1018,2024-05-02,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,many say that he gets a lot of heat but here is normal legal temperature  better cost benefit intel
1019,2023-06-08,5,27500,Italy,13400F,i bought this intel core i5 13400f processor to update my old pc and i am very happy with my choice the processor is ideal for those looking for a powerful  fast and efficient processor  suitable for both gaming and work it has 16 cpus in total and i find myself much better to editing videos on youtube it no longer warms like my old cpu  i am very happy with the choice 
1020,2024-02-28,5,27500,France,13400F,works well with the first use 
1021,2024-03-16,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,leaves an i3 12400f for him and gave a big difference in the games  the only problem is the high temperature  but that a good air cooler already solves
1022,2023-02-10,5,27500,Spain,13400F,it is phenomenal mounted on a gigabyte b660m ds3h  kingston  rx6600 and 2 nvme pcie 4 0 memories with liquid cooling of 240 it reaches a maximum of 60 ° with a stress test  thanks to this unreasonable updated bios plate it goes very well in games and in general 
1023,2024-04-05,5,27500,Germany,13400F,very faster cpu  my new pc runs faster than ever and without problems    
1024,2024-01-08,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,i knew there was two versions of the i5 13400f based on alder and raptor  but the raptor was as rare as hens teeth in retail  supposedly kept for the oem market and for slightly more power and without a boxed cooler  well what did i get  the raptor around 5  quicker than alder  anything quicker in pc gaming is a plus  lol you can also recognize stepping b0  raptor lake  in a better catalog by the s spec code  which is srmbg  it differs from stepping c0  alder lake  s spec code srmbn  in the last letter of the designation – “g” instead of “n” check the cpu die as per my picture  it also shipped with the laminar rm1 cooler on my msi mag tomahawk wifi ddr5  happy days  check the net for more tech by inputting the two spec codes above  i’m playing cyberpunk 2077 and an rtx 4060 ti at 1440p everything on ultra using super dlss and getting near 100fps  bearing in mind it’s both cpu and gpu intensive  superb processor 
1025,2024-05-18,5,27500,France,13400F,very good as a processor
1026,2024-01-04,5,27500,Italy,13400F,combined with a gtx 3060 video card  the maximum resolution processor does not go further and 40 percent it seems strange but responds perfectly to gaming there is no need to go to the i7 or i9 to play it is enough and advances the i5 13400 always amd today intel i think it s better at least until now in summer we will see if and how much he warms
1027,2024-05-09,5,27500,Spain,13400F,as i expected
1028,2024-06-13,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,what a sexy chip this is easy to install lighting fast   10 cores 16 threads  very happy  would defiantly recommend  
1029,2024-04-05,5,27500,Germany,13400F,optimal price performance ratio 
1030,2024-02-16,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,very good processor  the only problem is the temperature  it will need a more robust cooling system
1031,2023-12-03,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,bought it as an upgrade from my last and it has been perfect so far 
1032,2024-04-22,5,27500,Germany,13400F,very happy  i upgrade from an i5 9th gen 9600kf  night and day on some game   very chill in temp with my arctis freezer ii 280mm  40 50° in game
1033,2024-04-30,4,27500,France,13400F,good processor for gaming and office automation
1034,2023-12-21,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,very good performance and delivery was done on time everything perfect 
1035,2023-08-13,5,27500,Spain,13400F,good power and heated little 
1036,2024-05-05,5,27500,Italy,13400F,excellent article 
1037,2023-12-23,5,27500,France,13400F,this is not the best price performance price but the processor remains very good to run any game in 1440p ultra at 165 hz  for my case  i strongly recommend it because it is one of the best in the range
1038,2024-04-04,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,a good gaming cpu
1039,2023-11-15,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,product according to my expectation
1040,2023-12-04,5,27500,Spain,13400F,i have mounted it with a 4070 and is perfect  the best purchase of components that i have made
1041,2023-06-10,4,27500,Italy,13400F,i decided to stay on intel although amd proposed good products among the different variants i opted for the 13th gen and so far i have not been disappointed excellent tdp and fully enough for my needs screen data are taken with bland use  browser  discord  steam and a very simple game almost like a mobile phone  fallout shelter   eye to any bottlenecks in the mating with a gpu  which i have not yet taken   already witha 4070 we are slightly below
1042,2024-01-02,5,27500,France,13400F,the product suits me enormously  i had it after 2 days and very well wrapped 
1043,2023-08-01,4,27500,Brazil,13400F,the product has arrived all ok and working perfectly  the price was great  but there are some caveats  the product arrived with the box well kneaded  may be more careful in packaging and transportation  and the delivery besides long delayed 2 days 
1044,2023-10-07,5,27500,Germany,13400F,the cpu is very good and highly recommended with an rtx 3060ti
1045,2024-03-17,5,27500,Italy,13400F,great seller and great product
1046,2023-02-14,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,10 cores for £200  i have this running with a 3070ti with zero processor bottle neck   check your motherboards bios before installing though as it will need to be on the latest to run the new 13th gen processors  i found that out the hard way because i bought a new motherboard at the same time and had to borrow a 12th gen processor to be able to update the bios  all good now though running 10 10 and future proof 
1047,2024-02-06,5,27500,Italy,13400F,damaged article you can have the return thanks
1048,2023-08-08,4,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,it’s not a bad cpu at all for the price and works great for gaming  yes there are better but more money
1049,2024-06-13,1,27500,France,13400F,a ventirad received but the processor was not there i ask for reimbursement
1050,2023-11-03,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,excellent product  it delivers what it promises
1051,2023-06-11,2,27500,Spain,13400F,i bought it for the price  if i could  i would have bought the 13600k
1052,2024-01-06,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,would recommend this cpu to anyone it is so quick doesn t break a sweat  
1053,2024-01-14,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,good
1054,2023-11-11,5,27500,Italy,13400F,excellent purchase  recommended in this period considering that it costs € 50 less than when i bought it on a qualitative level i recommend it certainly has excellent performance for my high  end computer    
1055,2023-05-30,4,27500,France,13400F,excellent processor  10 hearts including 4 economical my only regret is that windows also manages its resources  and wakes up in turn all hearts  or almost  when you do nothing but look at the performance      notation grid  style note    what is it supposed to note here the color of the processor 
1056,2023-11-25,5,27500,France,13400F,installing on my gamer config  it responds well  associated with a good graphics card  it will allow you to have a powerful computer to be able to play for hours
1057,2023-12-09,5,27500,Italy,13400F,everything ok    with satisfied operation and operation
1058,2023-11-29,5,27500,Italy,13400F,everything s fine excellent processor and perfect delivery times
1059,2023-10-23,3,27500,Italy,13400F,i bought this article a couple of day  i go to assemble the pc i open and see the broken fan  i wrote to the seller but they wrote to me that the offices were closed  i rewritten and still nothing  so i decided to review
1060,2023-12-18,5,27500,France,13400F,delivered quickly  with a nickel original ventirad
1061,2024-02-06,2,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,i like intel cpu s and i know this one is good value for money  however  the internal box came damaged while the main amazon box was fine  meaning amazon packed an already damaged product
1062,2023-03-14,5,27500,Italy,13400F,i was looking for a powerful and at the same time not too expensive processor and my choice fell on this needless to say  a wonder goes  excellent for both gaming and quite heavy work i kept his original heatsink for a practical choice and in full load he never exceeds 70 degrees i combined it with a gigabyte b660 and 32gb of 3600mhz ram and i can only be satisfied 
1063,2024-06-09,1,27500,Germany,13400F,i   also  i am not the only commenter in this case   received only a fan in my order  dont buy it
1064,2023-09-10,5,27500,Italy,13400F,if you don t have too many needs  and excellent 
1065,2024-04-13,1,27500,Italy,13400F,buyed used as new  there was only the damaged box  in a nutshell only and only the heatsink arrived but the cpu was missing  moreover the dissatrue fan was broken  i don t know if it started like this or if it was the delicacy of the postman in launchingthe package at the time of delivery  i returned the product immediately    
1066,2023-07-15,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,much better than equivalent 12th gen  more cores   more power
1067,2023-04-26,5,27500,Italy,13400F,i am not an expert  but i was looking for a processor that would allow me to play and work resisting the test of time well so far everything great  the benchmarks are also with a high score therefore a ok
1068,2023-09-17,5,27500,Italy,13400F,great product
1069,2023-02-02,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,i recently upgraded from the i5 8400 and this cpu was definitely worth it  my overall performance on my rig has increased with more smoother outputs and no stuttering at all on games i play   easy to install and 100  worth it 
1070,2023-09-04,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,the order arrived very fast and the product is exactly as i expected  super satisfied  i recommend
1071,2023-03-09,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,so far so good only had it installed for 3 days but working very well  and i chose not to pay the £10 delivery and it was still sent out with dpd
1072,2024-06-11,1,27500,France,13400F,do not buy  apartment if you want to receive a box with just a ventirad 
1073,2023-07-08,5,27500,Germany,13400F,pretty everywhere does a top performance  easy installation
1074,2023-05-24,5,27500,Italy,13400F,service on par with amazon  buy sold by amazon or from them is the same  perhaps better to them
1075,2023-09-01,5,27500,France,13400F,i get what i expected   perfect delivery  
1076,2023-09-19,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,delivery on time working perfectly 
1077,2023-09-25,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,i was surprised    
1078,2023-06-30,5,27500,Germany,13400F,works as designed 
1079,2023-04-02,5,27500,Germany,13400F,price performance is great everything as you get used to by intel
1080,2023-01-20,5,27500,Germany,13400F,comparable to a 12600k     a little weaker but significantly less energy consumption      runs here on a tuf b660      absolutely blatant cpu price a bit high  still      but i couldn t wait   
1081,2023-05-22,5,27500,Germany,13400F,super 
1082,2023-04-03,5,27500,Italy,13400F,stable with respectable performance in the medium  high range
1083,2023-01-16,5,27500,Germany,13400F,super cpu i have a gigabyte b660 gaming x and with the bios update everything went great windows has started directly 
1084,2023-07-08,5,27500,France,13400F,ideal for gaming
1085,2024-06-12,5,31700,India,13500,super speed enough for heavy editing  value for money  i will recommend this  i bought for 23000 rupees before six months 
1086,2023-09-16,5,31700,Sweden,13500,great cpu for video editing and gaming
1087,2023-07-18,5,31700,the United Kingdom,13500,there is little reason to look beyond i5 cpus for anything other than heavy workstation loads   this cpu with 6 hyper threaded performance cores  12 threads  plus 8  efficiency  cores  which are pretty fast in their own right  has a total of 20 threads  it s performance is outstanding   the best part about it is the efficiency  this is a 65w tdp part  boosts to 154w   and whilst idling is only drawing 15 18w  this makes it very easy to cool  in my small form factor case  i m able to keep the cpu at 25°c 30°c above ambient temperature   whilst gaming  i m yet to see utilisation above 25   for productivity loads  it chews through most tasks thrown at it with aplomb   if you are wanting to overclock  the i5 13600k is the step up you need  but for everything else  this cpu is fantastic 
1088,2024-03-03,5,31700,Italy,13500,the cpu is excellent and travels very well also in gaming  be careful if you have intentions to overclock the temperatures because if stressed the degrees they go up  consagged 
1089,2024-03-02,5,31700,Germany,13500,very economical and quick
1090,2023-12-24,5,31700,Spain,13500,it is not any i5  it has 14 nuclei and 20 threads  it also consumes 65w  which can be requested more
1091,2024-02-02,5,31700,Germany,13500,play video cpu is top  i can play with this cpu with my rtx 4070 in all games ultra setting 
1092,2024-01-03,5,31700,France,13500,super this i5 13500  taken to replace an i5 9400f it s impressive i recommend this processor for office use  video editing for the game  i cannot give my opinion  i am not a gamer the integrated video card is more than enough for my use small advice  used a good ventirad it is better to provide it with the assembly your processor will make it good 
1093,2024-01-06,5,31700,the United Kingdom,13500,play video you can save on cpu cooler but later you will have to get new cooler anyway because it hits 99°c on heavy loads  good for htpc and sff builds 
1094,2023-06-22,5,31700,Sweden,13500,works great with rtx 3070 and 3000mah
1095,2023-12-11,5,31700,Germany,13500,the i5 is completely sufficient for almost everything top performance at the price is also enough for gaming
1096,2023-10-29,5,31700,Spain,13500,i went from an i5 9400f  so better  it seems strange as it was a 9th gen intel  but it works very well in conjunction with the rtx 3050  but would recommend a 3060 or 4060  
1097,2024-02-09,5,31700,the United Kingdom,13500,it is fast enough for a good gaming experience  i use 1440p with no problems
1098,2024-02-02,5,31700,France,13500,for my first pc i chose this processor renowned to offer work comfort and this is the case he consumes nothing and heats up very little he crushed my mac mini m1 so easily 
1099,2024-05-15,5,31700,Italy,13500,very fast cpu excellent for gaming and runs out very little recommended who wants a cpu that does not cost much 
1100,2023-01-30,5,31700,Sweden,13500,best value cpu nothing else below 13500 in raptor lake series even comes close  both 13100  and 13400 are truly awful overpriced value at the moment of writing this 
1101,2023-11-16,5,31700,Germany,13500,the intel core i5 13500 is a promising addition to intel s lineup  offering a significant leap in performance and efficiency compared to its predecessors  boasting an improved architecture and advanced technology  this processor is tailored for mainstream users seeking a balance between power and affordability   performance wise  the i5 13500 demonstrates commendable speed and responsiveness in handling everyday tasks  with its increased core count and upgraded architecture  multitasking feels smoother and more efficient  whether it s browsing the web  streaming content  or running office applications  this processor handles these tasks effortlessly   gaming performance on the i5 13500 is notably improved  offering respectable frame rates in most modern games  while it may not match the prowess of higher end processors in demanding gaming scenarios  it provides a solid gaming experience for the price  especially when paired with a capable gpu   one of the standout features of the i5 13500 is its improved power efficiency  the processor s optimized architecture ensures better thermal performance and lower power consumption  contributing to a cooler and more energy efficient system   furthermore  the i5 13500 s compatibility with the latest hardware technologies ensures future proofing and offers room for system upgrades  its integration with ddr5 memory and support for pcie gen 5 are welcome additions for users looking to build or upgrade their systems for longevity   in conclusion  the intel core i5 13500 impresses with its commendable performance  enhanced power efficiency  and future ready features  while not aimed at power users or enthusiasts  this processor stands as a solid choice for mainstream users  offering a well balanced blend of performance and value for everyday computing tasks and moderate gaming needs 
1102,2023-09-23,4,31700,France,13500,carton lacks protection  the only reproach
1103,2024-04-05,4,31700,Italy,13500,excellent processor  i m not sure to find out but for almost 300 euros the cooler provided is inadequate at full load the 90 degrees are passed with relative throttling and therefore you lose in performance i recommend combining the processor with a serious heatsink  i took a thermalright 120 if an air  which means setting into account 30 40 euros more for something that had to be decently provided together with the cpu 
1104,2023-07-09,5,31700,the United Kingdom,13500,this was a replacement for an old intel 4430  which i thought was fast when i first used it years ago  this is much quicker and has allowed me to load windows 11  i m not used to such speed  obviously there are much quicker cpus available  but i don t do much processor intensive stuff  so this one is more than sufficient 
1105,2023-03-29,5,31700,Spain,13500,first of all  i am not an expert in measuring performance and others but the speed and performance jump on a day  to  day life  i am a designer and shot a lot of photoshop premiere after  with my previous i7 8700 has been brutal do not heat up  with the same ventilados cooler master dissipator he had for the i7   being 50 65 of the maximum load yes  like me  you were thinking about this or an i7 previous generation  do not hesitate  you save money and the performance is great 
1106,2023-05-21,5,31700,Sweden,13500,not a single restart  quality
1107,2023-08-20,5,31700,Germany,13500,a very good cpu for a mid  range all  round pc very efficient and economical but still powerful    
1108,2024-01-18,5,31700,Italy,13500,then i had to upgrade to my 8  year  old old  year  old pc even if top of the range since it mounted an i7 6850k and an msi gaming pro carbon argb motherboard  so not having a high budget i first opted for a ryzen 5800x but i did well2 rendered both cpu and motherboard as amd does not guarantee the stability of its cpus and bios in general  also confirmed by many people that the amd cpus or merge or do not start after updating the bios  so i opted for thisi5 13500 and i must say that it is fantastic for the price it has     unlike the 5800x  it started at the first start with msi pro z790 p wifi motherboard updated bios and gaming in 2k or qwhd     amazon always precise and serious both in deliveries and in the return      
1109,2024-03-04,5,31700,France,13500,very good mid  range product  perfect for stream and play at the same time 
1110,2023-03-23,5,31700,Spain,13500,excellent for any task recommended buying for less than € 260
1111,2024-01-07,5,31700,Italy,13500,13th generation processor  warms little and despite the other frequencies consumes little energy it does not have the multiplier unlocked  but i don t care  it is very efficient for the two types of processors within the called  economy and power compatible with pci express 5 does not disappoint expectations     
1112,2023-08-17,4,31700,Germany,13500,i bought this processor with a motherboard a few weeks ago  the processor is doing as expected but i removed a star for the bad packaging  still recommend the processor at 100   
1113,2023-05-19,5,31700,Sweden,13500,good price and fast delivery
1114,2023-02-03,1,31700,Spain,13500,all the chores to maximum processes only opening the browser  microcongellations and very important pulls in games with any graph  1060 and 3070  temperatures up to 84 ° with a dissipator of 6 copper tubes  surely with the stock it goes out  does notyou throw multitasking because a fuck is overheat more cores is not always better ecores are more problematic than potential if you are looking for generation 13  this is not correct 
1115,2024-05-22,5,31700,France,13500,so many hearts in such a small processor 6 p core with hyperthread which makes 12 powerful virtual hearts  and 8 economic hearts on the other hand with the original ventirad we arrive very quickly at 100 ° c and therefore the limitation of the cpu  which is why i recommend a good big efficient fan if you want to fully draw part of the capacities of this processor 
1116,2024-03-02,5,31700,Germany,13500,everything is fine  gladly again 
1117,2023-06-08,5,31700,France,13500,the parallel compilation is fast  works very well in a b660 motherboard please note  buy a b660 motherboard with cpu less firmware update  for example gigabyte q flash you probably have to update the firmware before installing the cpu manages 128 gb of ram buy a cheap air cooler was 11  faster for me with appropriate cooling compared to the intel cooler probably will last longer too 
1118,2024-02-05,5,31700,Italy,13500,found with an offer at a perfect price for what it offers 
1119,2023-10-17,5,31700,France,13500,without loss of performance with a lesser consumption  i recommend  not neglect the mother card buy good 
1120,2023-10-31,5,31700,Germany,13500,for the price it works okay
1121,2024-04-03,5,31700,Italy,13500,intel a garanza  recommended 
1122,2023-12-25,5,31700,Italy,13500,really excellent if purchased for 250 euros and not 280 as i took it in my configuration it is combined with a 7800 xt and asus h770 tuf gaming pro wi fi with 32 gb ddr5 6000mhz ram  which however this processor cannot manage over 4800m and therefore will not go over 4800mhz  in games like cyberpunk in 4k comes to be used at 70 80   so i would say that it does its job great as a temp  it arrives on 60grads coupled to an aio with 500w tdw edit and add  in other cpu consumer games such as battlefield 2042 and star citizen and above all in this it starts to struggle  making a slight bottleneck above on 4k where it starts working at 100     i am starting to think about whether to move on to a more modelperformant    
1123,2024-02-27,5,31700,Italy,13500,excellent compromise paid just over 13400 arrived with a heatsink that i do not use having the liquid one
1124,2024-01-06,4,31700,France,13500,for 4k gaming  light application and multimedia  it is a bit like too much lol so for my use i am very satisfied for the heavier application i cannot say small flat can be for the price which in my opinion should be more around € 230 
1125,2023-12-13,3,31700,Italy,13500,then the intel i5 13500 in itself 5 stars i am forced to put 3 stars for the stock digger that is worth it 1  a fairly shameful thing not so much for the noise that is still annoying under load but i did a stress test i tried heavy applications for the cpu same result  the temperature was comfortably on 100 ° c and beyond even the assembly of the cooler one thing to have to confess always been quite simple with these intel dissipators but this i don t know did not enter the piston well  once they entered they did not hook  it is not clear the verse of the 4 feet in short  a reverse thing really improper i took a not too expensive noctua on the fly cpu result under maximum stress at 73 ° c temperature now while writing 27 ° the health of the processor silent pc to the maximum despite 8 total fans obviously that it requires some time to mount a decent heatsink so intel evidently prefers to provide a product that assembles quickly and does not deal with space but so you overdo it because those temperatures are not good for the product that is truly a prodigy of human technology 
1126,2024-02-14,5,31700,Italy,13500,in my opinion produced  good bike no quick problem satisfied with the article
1127,2024-01-25,5,31700,Italy,13500,i5 of 13 generation lga 1700 excellent quality excellent price
1128,2024-01-11,5,31700,Italy,13500,even with games or heavy programs it goes like a train never a hesitation heat little optimal
1129,2023-11-24,5,31700,Germany,13500,this processor is worth the money  no high grades  just high fps 
1130,2023-10-02,4,31700,Italy,13500,excellent processor  if the price drops is a great purchase 
1131,2023-09-24,4,31700,France,13500,good processor  i mounted it in a gaming configuration  it is enough  does not heat for the price at which i got it i am satisfied 
1132,2023-12-07,5,31700,Italy,13500,according to the technician who installed it to me  everything perfect
1133,2023-11-22,5,31700,Italy,13500,easily mounted on the motherboard  also performing for games  a little expensive
1134,2023-07-27,5,31700,Germany,13500,at this price  this is a very good proposition due to the price  quality ratio in addition  with water cooling  the processor is about 30 degrees at rest and does not exceed 55 degrees under load at low power consumption
1135,2023-05-21,5,31700,Germany,13500,this  little  colleague is the really appealing gpu performance with his 14 cores and 20 threads     i can recommend     only the fan is not enough in my opinion     which the boy is goodwarm on the go with arithmetic     what he can     but mine got a noctua fan and is happy about 10   15 degrees cooling     that was well invested € 55 in the long run     we both found 😉😄
1136,2023-08-24,5,31700,Germany,13500,the cpu is inexpensive and performance very good has not yet disappointed me with any game and is recommended 👍
1137,2023-09-15,5,31700,Italy,13500,at this price there is no better absurd processor never managed to put under stress except with benchmark  temperatures always under 60 degrees  averal 47 55  
1138,2023-04-05,4,31700,Germany,13500,unfortunately the cpu cooler was broken otherwise a great part  because i don t bother me another cooler anyway the delivery was on time 
1139,2023-11-15,5,31700,France,13500,good in all that we will ask him and good packaging
1140,2023-10-25,5,31700,Italy,13500,if the price is about 250 euros      unbeatable quality price 
1141,2023-04-20,5,31700,Germany,13500,this processor not only saves you a lot of electricity because of the minimum power of 65w but also has a maximum power of up to 154w and can therefore start all games without any problems and then no 13600k or 13700k let alone 13900k are necessary
1142,2023-09-29,5,31700,Italy,13500,a bestial processor for 250 euros a 14 core and 20 fantastic tree
1143,2023-05-25,5,31700,Germany,13500,what is there to say  everyone who buys the processor will know what he wants to do with it box fan will certainly hardly be installed  it is quite loud and freaky 
1144,2023-02-17,5,31700,France,13500,i went from an i3 12100f to this i5 13500 and it is the day and night level performance nothing can resist him  i also found a completely stable framerate and without strettering on  cpu heavy  games  such as battlefield 2042  a real treat for the moment i hesitated for a long time with the 13400f but finally for about fifty euros more  we are entitled here to a real indestructible bulldozer 
1145,2023-10-13,5,31700,Italy,13500,excellent processor suitable for everything
1146,2023-08-19,5,31700,Germany,13500,performance is good
1147,2024-01-15,2,31700,Germany,13500,cpu cooler is too small and doesn t cover the whole cpu  not worth buying with cooler 
1148,2023-10-15,2,31700,Italy,13500,i did not expect that in 2023 from such an important company as an intel that it is not able to provide a worthy stock digger      while i was mounted on the motherboard by pushing the assembly pin on the one hand  it detached itself on the other     ache ifit was well anchored and rotated      in addition to the fact that fortunately the very high saved us from other possible serious installation problems by providing the designers of a minimum ingenuity in placing beads bound on the processor since the beat of the verse is microscopic    
1149,2023-07-03,5,31700,Germany,13500,the usual good quality   decent performance   low power consumption perfect solution for daily needs of a home pc 
1150,2023-04-14,5,31700,Germany,13500,i use it in a media server  the igpu is insane for transcoding  for everything else  it is a good cpu  70 c max with a thermalright assassins king 120 
1151,2023-07-06,5,31700,France,13500,perfectly does the job requested in a nas with several vm and exceptional in a video transcoding on the other hand  plan to change the original ventirad which makes an unbearable noise when the cpu is in full load 
1152,2023-04-01,5,31700,Germany,13500,the processor impressed me very quickly  no matter for which application  be it gaming or anything it is definitely worth it for the price  i can only recommend it 
1153,2024-02-14,2,31700,France,13500,package and packaging in perfect condition but a pale of the fan provided is broken the only solution is to return everything  wait for the refund and order again or an additional delay of at least a week a commercial gesture would be preferable  after the return of the fan only
1154,2023-03-27,5,31700,France,13500,buy for stream and play on the same pc idle temperature  27 degrees ingame  55 degrees with a masterliquid ml360 cooler masterliquid ml illusion very good perf in 1440p with a rtx 3070 ti tuf gaming and a mag b760 tomahawk wifi ddr4 i recommend 
1155,2023-08-25,5,31700,France,13500,good processor for my first pc gaming  ras for the moment  only happiness 
1156,2023-07-26,5,31700,France,13500,the best q p of the 13th on the i5  it does not heat it is very close to the i5 13600kf 
1157,2023-06-24,5,31700,France,13500,for its price i find it at the top coming from a 10900f  i have a really interesting gain coupled with the ddr5 6000 and a b760  it s nickel 
1158,2023-04-03,5,31700,Germany,13500,product arrived on time  seal intact  box is not damaged  processors works great  recommended 
1159,2023-05-28,5,31700,France,13500,chosen to replace my aging i7 8700k  coupled with an asus rog stix b760 a gaming wifi d4  does not heat too much with a aio corsair in 240mm
1160,2023-02-07,5,31700,France,13500,little use for the moment to make it an exaustive analysis no a priori problem very surprised by the efficiency and silence of the small ventirad intel supplied obviously a more substantial ventirad will be preferable for more intensive use as for gamers 
1161,2023-08-20,5,31700,France,13500,very good processor  fast  do not heat 
1162,2023-03-21,5,31700,Germany,13500,i m impressed by the quality and does what it should 
1163,2023-07-23,5,31700,France,13500,good cpu which does not heat by being very powerful 
1164,2023-04-15,5,31700,Italy,13500,arriving punctual and mounted on pc with asus prime z790 p motherboard is a bomb very fast 
1165,2023-04-06,5,31700,Germany,13500,used it on my new motherboard 
1166,2023-04-01,5,31700,Germany,13500,sufficient cpu for gaming 
1167,2023-06-21,5,31700,France,13500,unbeatable price very powerful material to play on gourmet games 
1168,2023-02-22,5,31700,France,13500,make close to the performance of the 13600k  it remains a processor capable of doing everything he perfectly manages my rtx 3080 and nothing scares him today 
1169,2023-08-19,2,31700,Italy,13500,product that arrived in its originally destroyed original packaging the original heatsink came destroyed i did not try the cpu but there were signs of clear use the cpu deserves so much overwhelmed by the various reviewers one of the best cpu value for money 
1170,2023-04-17,2,31700,Germany,13500,i have a b760 gaming x  my 13700k has no problems with a 4000 cl16 kit the 13500 only creates 3000 mhz ram clock in the gear 1 3200 starts and runs after a week  but i had a shot windows and have now found with a memor that there is about 15 errors per hour at 3200mhz unacceptable 
1171,2024-02-10,1,31700,Italy,13500,the processor is excellent but arrived with the broken fan because it delivered inside paper bag 
1172,2023-02-03,5,31700,France,13500,i ordered this processor because of its 14 hearts and its low consumption
1173,2023-05-15,5,31700,France,13500,ràs  turns like a clock 
1174,2023-01-26,3,31700,France,13500,compared to the i5 12400f that he replaces  i do not see a difference 
1175,2023-11-25,5,46500,India,13600K,nice product     you can go for it

1178,2024-06-19,5,46500,Canada,13600K,creation of a new computer to replace my old death suddenly 
1179,2024-01-06,5,46500,Japan,13600K,cospa is good
1180,2024-04-26,5,46500,Brazil,13600K,it s intel right  just put it and that s it of course you can configure some things to perform more but basically it s just putting it will have a great performance about durability or if you will have a problem  only time can show 
1181,2024-01-08,5,46500,Mexico,13600K,it is a processor beast  to mount from a 3060 to 4090  of the best
1182,2024-03-29,5,46500,Canada,13600K,words cannot describe the change in performance  i thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before i upgraded  now i see although it was decent  i was missing a lot  my rtx 2080 super didn’t get upgraded this year but i’m sure it’ll need to by next year as it’s now always peaked at 100  in games  while my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground  this 13600k sits around 20 30  usage and around 50 degrees celsius in most situations   depending on the motherboard  you may want to tweak “cpu lite load” settings  my msi mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current  now dialed back to mode 9  i have lost no performance what so ever  i actually gained almost a thousand extra points in cinebench by not letting it get hot   overall i’m very happy and would highly recommend this cpu to anyone 
1183,2023-12-10,5,46500,Japan,13600K,the best choice for recent middle  class pcs  which is excellent in cospa that can be evolved
1184,2023-09-28,5,46500,Japan,13600K,in order to deceive the cost  i purchased it as a grabo  power supply  cooler  cpu  mazabo  m 2  etc  from last year and this year at present  ↓↓↓ os is upgraded from 10 to 11 cpu is this product mazabo is msi mag z790 tomahawk wifi ddr4 grabo rtx3060ti memory is ddr4 3200 power supply 850w m 2 for gen4 1tb cooler gen4 1tb cooler maintains about 80   specifications without the latest air  cooled sticker  and updates the worrisome place this time it feels like i did it for the first time in a long time i am very crisp and thankful for the times 
1185,2024-01-25,5,46500,the United States,13600K,beast for gaming you ll never feel any bottlenecks with 99 9   of any titles pair very nice with 4070ti  the temperatures are never over 60 under heavy load  if you care about longevity of cpu this is the best pick for you

1191,2024-06-09,5,46500,Canada,13600K,currently running oc 5 3ghz   lovely 
1192,2024-03-29,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i have had no issues with this processor  the temps are low even when heavily gaming  this pc is gonna last a really long time 
1193,2024-03-16,5,46500,Canada,13600K,fast clock speed  more than sufficient for everyday workloads  gaming  3d rendering  and running heavy computations 
1194,2023-09-17,5,46500,Japan,13600K,ascavenen of stable diffusion is 15 seconds for 13600k and 4070ti considering that ryzen5 1600 and 4070ti were 24 seconds  i think cpu is important for the comfort of generated ai i wonder if the ddr4 2400mhz to 6000mhz of ddr5 is also related to the good response i could afford the multitasking while generating  and i was glad i bought it 
1195,2024-02-13,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i just built my first pc and i decided to go with this intel cpu  the pc has been running great and i’ve had now issues with anything i’ve tried to do with it  it’s fast and can support both gaming and multitasking 
1196,2023-01-14,5,46500,Mexico,13600K,i get the product well and sealed  in its presentation of caja chica  handles temperatures of 60 70 ° c with a 240 mm liquid cooling  quality price quality of 10 10
1197,2023-02-20,5,46500,Mexico,13600K,very good product
1198,2023-12-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i built myself and two sons computers for christmas all based on this cpu and it has performed flawlessly on all three pc s  it was easy to install  keeps cool on air cooling  and has compatibility with many motherboards  strongly recommended for gaming or general use computers 
1199,2024-02-26,5,46500,Canada,13600K,best bang on a budget for gaming  no need to pay 5 to 7 grand for top of the line computer 
1200,2023-09-05,5,46500,Japan,13600K,cool 
1201,2024-04-18,5,46500,the United States,13600K,very nice cpu and easy to install  always feels awkward holding this tiny piece of metal and mounting it to the motherboard  handles the tasks i need and never had issues 
1202,2024-01-01,5,46500,Canada,13600K,massive upgrade from my older i7 2600  very fast and works perfectly  watch for great pricing around the holidays 
1203,2024-01-20,4,46500,Mexico,13600K,the only inconvenience i see is that it heats up very fast however  with good ventilation  the pound very well 
1204,2024-01-06,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i have great fps  and it stays cool under load  i m running a 360 water cooler with it  and 6khz ddr5 ram  longevity remains to be seen  but so far i can say  good job intel  full ultra settings with no less than 60fps in gw2 with 150  players on the screen  150 fps  with small group battles 
1205,2023-01-06,5,46500,Japan,13600K,i can t make a professional review because i m not very familiar with it  but i can use it stably i mainly use it to work in adobe s illustrators i don t know how much grabo or memory work on the illustrator depends on the grabo or memory  but the cpu temperature does not exceed 30 degrees  so i can work crispy even with a little heavy data i thought that the price was a little expensive for i5  but i also saw information such as the performance that could be interacted with 12 generations of i7  so i think it is inevitable other specifications are used for grabo 3070ti and memory ddr4 3600mhz 64gb for reference 
1206,2024-02-15,4,46500,Canada,13600K,not bad but gets hot when using like photoshop or whatever
1207,2024-03-03,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i bought this to build a gaming pc with  but i like cpus that have a graphics option  this gives me a little wiggle room when i m debugging a system  when i m putting it together  i can get the mother board assembly out without plugging in a gpu   i m using this in a pc that primarily plays world of warcraft  a core i5 is plenty for that  i m sure an i3 is more than adequate  i m using a deep cool cooler in a well ventilated case and it doesn t get above 72 degrees celsius  51 degrees over ambient  i m not a cpu snob and have used amd and intel equally over the years  i wanted thunderbolt ports and that pretty much limited me to intel this go around  i am not disappointed  my machine gives me all the performance i need  fwiw  i m running a 7800xt gpu in the system if that is of any interest

1210,2024-03-25,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i have this in my newest rig and it is performing pretty well  very happy with the purchase
1211,2024-03-22,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i got really lucky and got a high performing chip  totally pleased with it and the ai overclocking on my asus rog board 
1212,2023-09-14,5,46500,the United States,13600K,there s really not much that needs to be said  if you re upgrading to 13th gen intel  and don t require the additional non gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k  you can t go wrong with the i5 13600k  even with xmp enabled to 6000mhz   a noctua nh u12a tower cooler on top  this beast never gets truly hot in any game  granted  i have a very good case for airflow  but regardless it s extremely rare i ever see this cpu hitting the 70 s when gaming  this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings   with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that  i paired this beastly cpu with the sapphire nitro plus radeon 6950xt   have been having an amazing experience all around  if you re deeply considering 13th gen    your main focus is gaming  then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end sku s give off  genuinely give this cpu a 10 10  never in my life did i ever anticipate an i5 to be this great  but just goes to show it s more about the generation and less about the number after the i  if you re considering the cpu but unsure as to its performance  i promise you wont be disappointed with it one bit  including with its temperatures  no under volting needed 
1213,2024-02-06,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i waited for a black friday deal to get this chip  and boy oh boy    i m blown away  i upgraded from an i5 8600k and the difference was clear  it was not clear eye  it was a monster of a cpu that can tear through any game you throw at it    as long as you pair it with a motherboard that doesn t hold back the power that is this processor 
1214,2024-01-15,4,46500,the United States,13600K,a great cpu  good value for money  i got mine during the black friday sale but do not use it for gaming  good power as long as it is paired with a good motherboard  ram and storage 
1215,2024-02-27,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i like that the new pc i built does not slow down when spinning up a linux vm in hyper v  the processor has plenty of threads and supports all the latest features and chipsets 
1216,2023-08-12,5,46500,the United States,13600K,update 12 3 23  with the release of the 14ty generation cpus  intel barely clawed an extra 1 2  performance wise in the 14600k  save your money and roll with the 13600k that continues to drop in price  this processor demolishes any workstation gaming task i throw at it   intel nailed the 13th gen i5 loading it up with 14 cores  this thing is a little devil in benchmarks  and for  300 at least  less than the 13900k  you can have a processor that stays in punching distance when gaming  absolutely killer value of you want to build a gaming rig with a quality processor that doesn t eat  600  i recommend getting the k version just in case for some reason one time you boot and your gpu doesn t read  your computer still has a gui  if you decide to go with an intel processor  this is the best price to performance option 
1217,2023-05-28,5,46500,the United States,13600K,oh  intel core i5 13600k  thou art a marvel of technology  a desktop processor that doth claim superiority  with clock speeds swift and cores so many  thou art a powerhouse for any task plenty   thine architecture  like a finely woven tapestry  doth deliver performance with utmost efficacy  the tasks that once did vex and stall  with thee at helm  they crumble and fall   thy clock speeds dance with lightning s might  bringing forth swiftness to computations in sight  from gaming realms to design and creation  thou art a boon to any technological vocation   thy cores  like warriors in a grand parade  march in harmony  their power never to fade  multitasking prowess  they do exhibit  as thou handleth multiple tasks  never to quit   though thou art not the most noble in intel s line  thy value and power  they doth brightly shine  for those who seek a balance of might and cost  thou art a choice that shall not be lost   so  let us raise our voices in great acclaim  to intel core i5 13600k  a processor of fame  in the realm of computing  thou reigneth high  a true companion for those who reach the sky 
1218,2023-01-23,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i bought this cpu for a media storage server i was building and i have not been disappointed  i am running unraid os with a number of docker containers including plex as well as virtual machines  having 20 vcpus is awesome for some low requirement virtual machines and it s transcoding ability is great for plex   a big reason i built a media server in the first place was to store my raw camera footage from storm chasing which is 4k 10bit which creates playback problems on a lot of hardware  it s just too large  i stood up a plex docker container and added my footage and this cpu handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it s great to go back and easily re live some of those storms   we also have a growing library of tv shows and movies and it also handles streaming those as well   i imagine this cpu would be awesome for gaming as well  but i don t have any experience with this chip and gaming but there are plenty of reviews that do go over that   overall i m happy with my purchase and would easily recommend this chip to anyone building a media server 
1219,2024-02-07,5,46500,the United States,13600K,best price to performance ratio in a cpu you would find today
1220,2024-01-07,5,46500,the United States,13600K,this is a very good cpu especially for the price  i love fast computers and don t see any reason to spend a lot more for very marginal gains 
1221,2022-12-16,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i love this cpu  it s marketed as a value chip for the performance conscious gamer   at least in the reviews i ve seen but that misses the mark  at 70 fewer watts than the i9 13900k you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance  and with a respectable multicore performance score as well   my chip actually runs faster than passmark says it should  but that might be because of my ram  i got the k chip to get faster ddr5 speeds  not faster clock speeds  since i m on air cooled  but at 5 1ghz i m not for want of more cycles   my last cpu was an amd ryzen 7 4750g  respectable for its day  but when i saw the performance of this intel i decided it was time for me to switch back   my recommendation is that if you re running an air cooled gaming system  strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9  you ll actually be able to keep it cool with a good cooler  i use a noctua nh dl12 with it and it s great 
1222,2024-01-26,5,46500,the United States,13600K,very fast and everything works just perfect with it
1223,2024-02-09,5,46500,the United States,13600K,fantastic
1224,2024-01-27,5,46500,the United States,13600K,the superhero of chips  nough  said  10 10  ign
1225,2023-11-04,5,46500,the United States,13600K,if you are building a pc for gaming  look no further than this cpu  just built a sff pc with this bad boy and an rtx 4070 for 1440p focused gaming and it absolutely dominates  getting 240 frames in overwatch 2 and consistently 200 fps in single player games in high quality 
1226,2023-10-19,4,46500,the United States,13600K,solid update from the 12 series  still selling for too much
1227,2023-09-13,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i am extremally happy with this cpu  blazing fast and very stable  runs supper cool  i am only running a dual fan cooler and it idles at 24c and when iracing stays in hi 40 s to low 50 s  only game  simulator i use is iracing  i use some hi tech 3d modeling programs  both really stress the cpu  i love this unit  cheap but loads of features 
1228,2023-07-30,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i m sure it ll be obsolete by the time someone reads this but right now this is the best cpu for the money   just look at the benchmark scores  it beats even the best cpus from 2 or 3 years ago and beats i7s from intels 12th gen easily  its great for video and audio editing  if it s for gaming  you ll be good with this for 10 years if the last 10 is anything to go by  and you can overclock it too to get even more out of it
1229,2023-04-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,absolute best bang for the buck    i wanted to go i9 or at least i7 but with this latest round of intel processors  the extra  100  150 per upgrade just did not seem worth it  i am very happy with my i5  paired with an rtx 3060 ti  i am running super smooth with ultra graphics on most games that i am playing   currently playing hogwarts in 4k borderless ultra graphics and ray tracing and maintaining 60 fps on a 4k television    love it  it is so much faster and smoother than my other pc running the latest amd processor 
1230,2022-11-26,5,46500,the United States,13600K,this cpu runs real fast when paired with good ram  i m hitting 25 500 in cinebench r23 multi core workload  i manually overclocked it to 5 3ghz p core  4 6ghz e core  it definitely produces a lot of heat  so make sure to get a big aio or high end air cooler  you do not want to cheap out on a cooling solution or else you ll be leaving performance on the table   only gripe with this cpu is the fact that intel markets this as a 14 core cpu  even when the e cores aren t exactly a big deal in game  those p cores do real good work  but the e cores are lacking  i don t like the  300  price tag on this  but it does beat ryzen 7000 series  so i m satisfied with my purchase 
1231,2023-05-02,5,46500,the United States,13600K,the 13th gen cpu s from intel are very impressive  this i5 is no slouch either and can throw its wieght around with the i7 and i9s of previous generations  in cinebench i got a score of 23605 points  i have an aio 360 ml cooler on it and my temps rarely get above 50c when im gaming or editing  at idle it stays around 30c  under load the temps did not go above 80c  this cpu will pair fine with any gaming setup and its ddr5 compatible with is a bonus 
1232,2023-12-16,5,46500,Canada,13600K,this cpu can handle 4k at max like making ice cream  and with a 4060 ti is just a cherry on top   beast of a cpu 
1233,2023-09-22,5,46500,the United States,13600K,up to standards  worried at the beginning since the processor was not set in place inside the box  but still works normally 
1234,2023-07-09,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i built my mom a new pc with this cpu  it is really fast  her last computer was 10 years old  this should last at least that long  the on board video this chip supplies works great for what she does which is email  youtube  ms office 
1235,2023-07-30,5,46500,the United States,13600K,absolute upgrade compared to my previous cpu but this one spits out heat like the summer sun  i believe you might want to invest with a good cpu cooler and properly do your install but it ll work like a champ 
1236,2023-06-23,5,46500,the United States,13600K,overclocked with basic settings on a z790 mobo  5 3ghz easy and maxes at 54 degrees c  under load  i upgraded mobo and cpu from a i7 7700k so i could get windows 11 and reduce my windows boot times from 2 minutes to about 8 seconds 
1237,2023-07-08,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i have been using this quite much and it’s great my laptop has the i7 and i’m use to a quick system and this has exceeded my expectations i have enjoyed the experience and think that i would use again for my next build 
1238,2023-09-28,5,46500,the United States,13600K,very impressive and outperforms previous gen i9 s when gaming while remaining easier to cool 
1239,2023-12-31,5,46500,Canada,13600K,effective
1240,2023-03-19,4,46500,the United States,13600K,i am using it for a sff build so not really the target market so if you are on the same boat then be sure to make time to tweak it 
1241,2022-12-02,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i was able to get my 13600k to 5 5ghz on the p cores and 4 2ghz on the e cores at 1 27v which equals to about 195 watts at 100  utilization   idles at 32c  55 60c while gaming  and maxes out at 88c on a 10 minute cinebench23 run  i get a score of 26100 in cinebench23   i paired this with an msi mpg z690 edge wifi  ddr5 6400 cl32  rtx 3080   a thermalright peerless assassin cpu cooler    gaming performance is amazing 
1242,2023-09-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,easy hookup for usb and external sata drives 
1243,2023-09-04,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i liked it a lot  i bought it for gaming and i do not regret my purchase
1244,2023-10-24,5,46500,Canada,13600K,i am using it with a 4070 ti  runs everything over 90 fps in 1440p with ultra graphics 
1245,2023-08-28,5,46500,the United States,13600K,great for mid range overclocking and pairs well with almost anything  worth it 100  
1246,2023-03-05,4,46500,the United States,13600K,no bottleneck here  i5 13600k is beast  intel definitely made one hell of a gaming cpu  that performs better than 5800x3d and it’s cheaper 
1247,2023-02-01,5,46500,the United States,13600K,upgraded from an i7 8700k and can say i am very happy with my upgrade  i got a noticeable jump in average fps  but the real improvement that can be felt while gaming was the increase in 1  low frame rates   this processor is a strong performer for the price   especially if you consider using ddr4 ram if you’re on a tight budget 
1248,2023-01-27,5,46500,the United States,13600K,went from i7 7700 to i5 12400f to i5 13600k  this processor is going to be in my machine for the next couple years  probably gonna skip 14th gen unless it’s mind blowingly better   i am paired with a 3070 ti currently  i would have no worries pairing this with any 40 series card  i might wait for next gen gpus as well 
1249,2022-12-12,5,46500,the United States,13600K,temps was going crazy high  100c in 3 of the 6 p cores with msi z690 edge but cinebench complete without throttling  found cpu lite load in oc settings on the board on mode12 the cpu was drawing around 225 watt and this was beyond the cpu specs which is 180 watt changed cpu lite load to mode 1 now the max temps are 87 and watt is around 195  great cpu
1250,2023-07-04,5,46500,the United States,13600K,for gaming this cpu is the best investment you can make    only weakness is multitasking high end video editing   
1251,2023-07-14,5,46500,the United States,13600K,swapped out my 10850k  5ghz for this chip  and across the board outperforms it for less power and thermals
1252,2023-05-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,get a good z790 chipset motherboard  and overclock this thing to  5 7 and you ll have the performance of a chip that s 2 3x the price for most users 
1253,2023-04-11,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i thought the 13th generation intel processor were suppose to run hot  this one does not with a 240mm radiator  with the radiator temperature is in the 30 s while gaming  at idle 20s 
1254,2022-12-11,5,46500,the United States,13600K,this is my first intel system i built  always been amd and saw the 13th gen out  figured was worth a try  it did not disappoint  only thing is the msi board overvolts it stock  so temps were always hitting 100 degrees  even with water cooling  set the vcore to 1 2v and no longer getting hot 
1255,2023-02-15,5,46500,the United States,13600K,absolutely annihilate everything i throw at it  if you re bot doing some serious rendering and only gaming then this cpu is for you  the 13600k should be good for another 10 15 years of gaming 5 10ghz 20 cores is enough to destroy anything you throw at it
1256,2023-05-22,5,46500,the United States,13600K,it is already installed on my computer is wonderful  it has not given me any problem and yields in everything i need 
1257,2022-12-01,5,46500,the United States,13600K,paired the i5 13600k with msi z690 a pro ddr4  running p cores 5 4ghz and e cores 4 2ghz without any issues  efficiency cores are powerful and they re equivalent to i7 9700k from few years ago  scores 25 592 in cinebench 23 with all cores  and 16 507 with e cores disabled  simply put  amazing  can t ask for more  this cpu has no competition  period 
1258,2023-04-15,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i think this cpu offers great value for the money  i runs everything at full settings  with 3060 gpu  and stays cool with noctua air cooling  recommended 
1259,2023-05-25,5,46500,the United States,13600K,fantastic chip   runs cool   and super fast   just buy it you know you want it     
1260,2023-02-11,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i upgraded from an i7 9700k to the i5 13600k  wow  huge difference  faster load times  better gaming frame rates in games that depend on the cpu more than the gpu  no stuttering in intense games  i am impressed  nice job  intel 
1261,2023-06-23,3,46500,Canada,13600K,bios flash to update the motherboard for it to be able to use this 13th gen cpu  but the flash didn t work so the cpu could never be read by my asrock steel legend motherboard  i have to buy a 12th gen cpu instead because of this problem assuming its the cpu that wasn t compatible with it 
1262,2023-09-20,5,46500,Canada,13600K,plug and plug  superb performance gaming
1263,2022-11-08,5,46500,Canada,13600K,loving the price to performance with the 13600k  considering i made the upgrade from a 6700k  the technology is leaps and bounds for roughly same value   there is also no reason to choose an amd5 cpu this year over the 13th gen intel chips  maybe a x3d but definitely not the 7000 series of cpus 
1264,2023-03-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,i had a 10700k before this  day and night  paired with a 4080 and it does 1440p 240hz on most titles without hiccups 
1265,2023-09-03,5,59999,India,13700K,this processor is absolutely incredible with no doubt’s… the only this you have to keep in mind that go for atleast 360 aio for more better performance…
1266,2023-03-28,5,59999,India,13700K,play video most powerful cpu at this price bracket no doubt  amazing performance love it
1267,2023-01-14,5,59999,India,13700K,this is my best buy so far for gaming and editing  it runs great whatever you throw  excellent performance so far  cinebench score is 29000 at 125 tdp   suggestion  buy only if you have very good amount of cooler 
1268,2024-06-17,4,59999,India,13700K,good
1269,2024-03-08,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i bought this to replace my 10850k after i realized how much it was holding back my 4090  i bought an asrock z790 pg lightning  d4 board to go with it so i could use my existing ddr4 ram  the difference was night and day  i have an id cooling 280mm aio  cheapest i could find on amazon  with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on cinebench r23 unless i run 3 or 4 passes back to back  i am thrilled with how well this cpu runs  i was able to bump my ddr4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1  timings cl20 26 26 26 48  after a bios update from asrock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast  i get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want   i have taken it to 5 7 and it runs fine  it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed  i m pretty sure i could overclock this beast to the moon if i threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop  but it is plenty fast as is  i have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k  i do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads 
1270,2024-06-13,5,59999,Canada,13700K,upgraded to the 13700k from the 11900k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive  this 13th gen i7 k is officially intel s fourth fastest cpu on paper but in real life it s the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it  13900k 14700k and 14900k  are all plagued with issues that intel won t discuss but admits to  albeit grudgingly  until a fix all patch is released  the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won t be bothered with unpredictable bugs and bsod fests  what good is it having a ferrari but with an engine that s goes offline 20 times a day  may as well go with a porsche that works  at that level of performance these high end cpu s more or less all perform equal  or would if they all worked properly   but it s easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30 day window for return to amazon is closed 
1271,2023-12-29,5,59999,Japan,13700K,in combination with rtx4070ti  most of the current games can be played with 4k settings it is cooled with simple water cooling  but the fans are quiet even in the game 
1272,2024-04-24,5,59999,Spain,13700K,very good brand
1273,2023-11-27,5,59999,the United Kingdom,13700K,might be overkill for most builds since i5 13600k is a very good choice as well 
1274,2023-02-23,5,59999,Brazil,13700K,i changed a core i7 11700 for him and felt a difference in performance  even using ram ddr4 memory 
1275,2024-01-11,5,59999,the United States,13700K,intel core i7 13700k  gaming beast with brawn and bandwidth  but not without bite overall rating  4 5 out of 5 stars  for  serious gamers  demanding content creators  overclocking enthusiasts  those upgrading from older systems  against  pricey compared to previous generations  runs hot  requires beefy cooling  performance  5 out of 5 stars  the i7 13700k packs a serious punch  its hybrid architecture with 8 performance cores and 8 efficient cores tackles demanding tasks with ease  whether you re pushing pixels in the latest aaa titles or crunching numbers in complex spreadsheets  this cpu thrives under pressure  in gaming  expect silky smooth frames at 1440p and beyond  even in the most demanding titles  compared to its predecessor  the i7 12700k  it offers a noticeable performance boost  especially in multi threaded workloads   overclocking  4 5 out of 5 stars  the i7 13700k is an overclocker s dream  it offers plenty of headroom for pushing clock speeds  unlocking even more performance potential  however  remember that this comes at the cost of increased power consumption and heat generation  ensure you have a robust cooling solution like a high end air cooler or aio liquid cooler to keep things under control   features  4 out of 5 stars  the i7 13700k boasts impressive specs  pcie 5 0 support for next gen hardware  ddr5 memory compatibility  and intel uhd graphics 770 for basic graphics needs  this future proofs your build and ensures you re ready for the latest tech as it emerges  however  keep in mind that the cost of ddr5 memory might still be a drawback for some   value  4 out of 5 stars  while the i7 13700k delivers fantastic performance  it comes at a premium price tag  compared to previous generations  the cost per core has increased  however  it still offers compelling value compared to its closest competitor  the amd ryzen 7 7700x  especially for gaming  remember  you ll need to factor in the cost of a capable cooler and potentially ddr5 memory  further impacting the overall value proposition   things to consider   heat and power consumption  this cpu runs hot  especially under overclocking  invest in a robust cooling solution to avoid thermal throttling  price  the i7 13700k is expensive compared to older generations and slightly pricier than its main competitor  consider your budget carefully  ddr5 compatibility  while future proof  ddr5 memory is still more expensive than ddr4  factor this into your overall build cost  final verdict   the intel core i7 13700k is a top tier processor for serious gamers  demanding content creators  and overclocking enthusiasts  its blistering performance  pcie 5 0 and ddr5 support  and overclocking headroom make it a future proof powerhouse  however  the high price  heat generation  and ddr5 compatibility requirements might be dealbreakers for some  if you re looking for the ultimate in gaming and multi core performance and have the budget for a premium build  the i7 13700k is a worthy investment  just be prepared to feed it some serious watts and keep it cool   note   this review is based on my own research and comparison of benchmarks  your results may vary depending on your specific hardware and software configuration
1276,2023-03-14,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,excellent processor delivery  by the seller  arrives in a small box   he had read from the pulparindo   confirmed  the functionalities provided by the processor are the best with 24 threads  always advisable to get a good liquid cooling at the moment i use the assembly for virtualization issues and is more than left over 
1277,2023-07-24,5,59999,Canada,13700K,this processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old i7 6700k  according to hwmonitor  the cpu package hovers around 15w power consumption doing desktop tasks  web browsing   email   office    compared to my i7 6700k  video card and psu unchanged  new motherboard  ram  and heatsink fan     system power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5w higher than my 6700k in normal mode  or about 15w lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings   synthetic benchmarks  3dmark cpu profile  indicate 2x performance for single core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads   real life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using powerdirector  note that this lga1700 socket is known to allow some bending  this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling   this can be remedied by installing a pressure plate  i bought a thermalright lga1700 bcf for around  12    if you don’t need a built in gpu  consider the i7 13700kf  the built in gpu is nice to have but not always worth the premium  if you also don’t plan to overclock  consider the i7 13700f 
1278,2023-03-01,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,the processor is excellent  quite fast for all tasks  the only one against it is the temperatures it handles  so i recommend matched with a good cooling system the excellent seller s service  i smile when i saw that the processor was packaged with a pulparindo  would give him another star just because of that 
1279,2023-04-29,5,59999,Japan,13700K,i heard that air  cooled could not be exhausted  but it was normally exhausted i don t know if it s overloaded    it s okay if you use a browser or play games normally 
1280,2024-03-10,5,59999,Canada,13700K,has really improved my gaming and streaming services along faster and better than my 7th gen i7
1281,2023-10-19,2,59999,Brazil,13700K,the processor is excellent  but delivery was desired  because it took a long time  another detail the box arrived all kneaded  lucky not to damage the processor 
1282,2023-01-14,5,59999,Japan,13700K,if you turn around 250w without power limit  i7 12700k is not opponent  but it is a performance that lightly pulls the i9 12900k  but it is too explosive as other people say     but even if you just set it to 190w  the same as i7 12700k  i am astonished cpu that surpasses the i9 12900k  so i  simple water cooling  is satisfied with the performance deterioration itself if you absolutely want to use it in air cooling  large   it seems that if it is around 140w  it can be cooled without any problem and it can be operated with lower power at all stronger than i7 12700k conclusion  a cpu with the best wat performance and a gentle fever if the power is restricted it seems like intel has been in vain to compete with a rival cpu 
1283,2023-09-26,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,i get fast  work very well
1284,2024-06-16,5,59999,the United States,13700K,wow welcome to a real gaming cpu  this runs good  have not oc  stays cool with my 360aio  no stability issues  nothing but a great freakn experience  very happy with this purchase 
1285,2023-07-20,5,59999,Canada,13700K,this is my first upgrade since the i7 4790k  this processor is a beast  eats away at any task i throw at it without a sweat  i was a little hesitant with the new cpu designs with the performance and efficiency cores but man  the efficiency cores alone kill my 4790k  👌🏻 great cpu  just make sure you know these shoot to the sky heat wise when you punch heavy workloads and you will need cooling to match depending of how long and how much you will need to pull away from it  👍🏻
1286,2024-02-20,5,59999,Canada,13700K,no surprises here  the cpu functions exactly as advertised 
1287,2023-02-15,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,the processor arrived in optimal conditions  in a timely manner i will update the review once you have installed and proved it properly at the moment  i can only comment on the seller who actually made the best and expedited sending 
1288,2022-12-18,4,59999,Japan,13700K,originally a replacement from the 7th generation i7 7700k the performance has been greatly improved  i am very satisfied  i have started a lot at the same time  such as distribution software  but there is no lack of processing performance so far however  the heat is easy to hold i don t know if it can be cooled if it is air  cooled     i use simple water cooling for your reference 
1289,2024-05-16,5,59999,the United States,13700K,purchased on sale for  334  the 13700k is the best value cpu if you require enough speed for high end gaming   productivity  e g  video editing rendering  streaming  multitasking  etc   this thing is fast  i was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5 5 ghz  all p core  and 4 4 ghz  all e cores   i could go higher if i wanted to spend more time on it  but this was a quick overclock  perfectly stable and runs  relatively cool with the undervolt  intel is still my preference for cpus and i don t foresee that changing  especially with all of the issues i ve read regarding amd chips  boot up issues  crashes  poor multi core performance  
1290,2022-11-23,5,59999,Japan,13700K,i was worried about the top model core i9 13900k  but i chose this core i7 13700k  which has improved peak performance and wattage with the same specifications of the core it is operated on the z690 motherboard  but there is no problem if the bios is compatible recent motherboards can be updated by bios if only power supply can be updated  so it is often not problematic even with non  supported bios it is recommended that the device drivers are updated in advance  or downloaded for new installation  the score of cinebenchr23 is multi  30552 and single 2082 the score is about 10   from the core i9 12900k  and the power consumption during the full load is about 30w lower  so it feels good i think that it is doing well with a process rule that has dropped a few generations compared to the current product of 10nm and other companies  but the 360mm simple water  cooled cooler is the same as alder lake the watt performance at full load is honestly subtle this time  i was very satisfied because it was for gaming pcs  so i will not encoding the video encoded processing main recommends ryzen 9 5950x  which is an old model that works without any problems with a large air  cooled cooler  but is easy to handle and is cheap if it is a game main  the core i7 13700k with high single thread performance is recommended because it has high wattage and cost performance 
1291,2023-03-27,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,it was what i expected  the delivery was in less the planned time and they took the trouble to include in gratitude for the purchase  excellent attention 
1292,2024-05-17,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i am a team blue guy  and i think this is a great cpu for the money  currently running at 5200 and very stable 
1293,2023-10-26,5,59999,Canada,13700K,what can you say about this processor that hasn t already been said  just know you need a good cooler on it  because it does get hot  performance is great and with intel s xtu app it is easy to overclock and achieve even more 
1294,2023-12-06,5,59999,the United States,13700K,my previous build had an i7 9700k and after 5 years of abuse  i decided to upgrade in this new build to an i7 13700k and i m not disappointed  it s a great cpu and is handling everything i throw at it  stays cool even without a fancy aio   liquid cooling setup  during the process of installing the cpu on the socket  it fell into place perfectly  but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the cpu into the socket  it did feel i had to put a bit more force than i would have thought necessary  but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues  highly recommended       complete parts list      msi mag z790 tomahawk wifi lga 1700 atx motherboard   https   www newegg com p n82e16813144567 item n82e16813144567  cable matters 2 pack 3 way 4 pin pwm fan splitter   https   www amazon com dp b07pxlhnz6 psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  arctic mx 4 thermal paste   https   www amazon com dp b0795dp124 psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  cablemod c series classic modmesh sleeved cable kit   https   www amazon com dp b07hmj6gnj psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details   2x  corsair vengeance ddr5 ram 5600mhz cl36   https   www amazon com dp b09wh64x5m psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  asus dual geforce rtx 4070 white oc 12gb ddr6x   https   www amazon com dp b0c4bzzwjm psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  nzxt h9 flow dual chamber mid tower   https   www amazon com dp b0bg1gqkky psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details   2x  corsair ll120 rgb triple pack   https   www amazon com dp b07lf1b1y8 psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  intel i7 13700k 16core   https   www amazon com dp b0bcf57fl5 psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  corsair rm850x full modular atx psu   https   www amazon com dp b08r5jptmz psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  rocketek 9pin usb header splitter   https   www amazon com dp b085kvh16t psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  deepcool ak400 cpu cooler   https   www amazon com dp b09pcwk7sp psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details  samsung 970 evo plus 1tb nvme m 2 ssd   https   www amazon com dp b07mfzy2f2 psc 1 ref ppx yo2ov dt b product details
1295,2024-05-13,1,59999,Japan,13700K,immediately after assembling  it became a blue screen due to a thermal runaway  and in order to pursue the current approval  i changed water cooling memory  replacing grabo  replacing power supply  but it was not improved at all  so i replaced it with the i5 1360kf i bought at the same time i can t understand it immediately after receiving it  and this warranty period is too short due to expensive shopping  and the cpu is not cheap  so the replacement is still a long time  and the games i can do are limited to the worst every day for a while 
1296,2022-11-24,4,59999,Canada,13700K,really love this processor it’s really fast using the adobe apps  recommended for content creation 
1297,2023-06-19,4,59999,the United States,13700K,after too many years of gaming on an old i7 6700k i finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year  i purchased the most up to date cpu and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did  overall i think this is a great cpu  however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things  intel just keeps pushing these cpus harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of amd  but in the process they are making cpus that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool  after a lot of tweaking in the bios i finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree celsius threshold  but that doesn t account for how hot it still makes my room when i m gaming  the extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months  but as summer is approaching i m wondering how this is going to pan out    anyway  the cpu is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box  i didn t run into any errors or issues with this cpu  overall i 100  recommend it because intel has never let me down  i ve been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too  so that s a pretty long track record of cpus that just worked and never died  because of that i can easily recommend this cpu and i would definitely order it again 
1298,2023-12-03,5,59999,Canada,13700K,fast arrived  well packaged  safely packed  but   one thing i almost put 1 star the delivery person put the box on a heating radiator in my apartment entrance  but overall product is high quality
1299,2023-04-03,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,great
1300,2024-06-02,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i would have opted for a slower cheaper version if i d known it ran this hot  but it works and will probably be fairly future proof for a while  most of what i do doesn t tax it at all  so it s cool and stable 
1301,2024-05-10,5,59999,the United States,13700K,overlocking the crap out of this with liquid cooling  rock solid   not a blue screen in site  dedicate 8 cores to a vm with no appreciable decline in bare metal os operation  temps are higher with the same cooler as compared to 12700k  12700k running 30 40c under load  this jumps to the 50 60c area pretty quick 
1302,2024-06-07,5,59999,the United States,13700K,good deal and for the delivery
1303,2023-12-26,5,59999,the United States,13700K,the highest package temps my cpu gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees celsius  and that s only for brief moments  average 68   75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background  maxes at the 253 rated watts for me  which really is fine  average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles   65 watts  which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen  no need to undervolt this cpu  even though you can  you ll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do  during the cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98   100 degrees celsius  but remember that s absolute max mode  99  of users will never use this cpu for more than several minutes at  if intel s extreme tuning utility does not automatically download when installing  definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it  it is easy to use  and you won t regret it  i just use it for monitoring performance  but you can use it for easy optimize and under overvolt with too  but i d recommend doing any of that through your motherboard bios if you decide to  most new bios s are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway  do your research on which to use and how  long story short if you want max performance to play around with just get a i9 processor  that s what those are made for  for everyone else there s this one 
1304,2024-05-11,5,59999,the United States,13700K,a very good midrange processor  i ve use one for years and it has always worked well for me

1310,2023-11-22,4,59999,the United States,13700K,i had a ryzen 7 3800xt cpu for a while now so i went for a new upgrade and went for intel for this generation  this processor works faster and better compared to what i had previously  this cpu is basicaly like an efficient i9 12900k  so if your looking for a high end processor just get this 13th gen  also at this time the 14th gen i7 just got released but based on the reviews its more like a 13th gen intel ks proccesor  that why i never went that route 
1311,2024-03-11,5,59999,the United States,13700K,spend the money once and get a good processor you wont regret 
1312,2024-01-17,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i was close to give them a bad review but then i found out usps was the problem with my delivery  if possible  find another shipping method to avoid delays  product exactly as described  much needed  now i can finish building my pc  thank you
1313,2023-02-01,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i built a new computer during the height of covid  dummy  i know  right   and decided on a i9 9900k  i m a sysadmin by trade  so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor  but for gaming  titles like cyberpunk  days gone  to even wow  there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k   i coupled this cpu with a msi edge z790 ddr4  i have fantastic samsung b die cl14 3600 ddr4 from the previous build   so far  in cyberpunk i m seeing 25 30 more fps on 1440p ultra settings w  raytraycing on high  wow is getting 50  more fps  and i m getting over 100 fps in valdrakken  where i was getting 45 50 fps with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk  1440p ultra  10 graphics settings    i m using the corsair icue h100i elite lcd 240mm aio  with thermal grizzly kryonaut extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy  and even at prolonged sessions in cyberpunk  my temps are not getting above 65c  and no  i have not done the contact plate mod   tl dr   this cpu is blazing fast  and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade  i don t claim to be steve from gamers nexus  or a pro cpu tester   but i can tell you that this thing is amazing  and will serve you well for years to come 
1314,2024-02-25,5,59999,the United States,13700K,without a doubt good cpu stays cool over clocked at 35 c runs good worth the money 
1315,2024-02-09,5,59999,the United States,13700K,quick dispatch  the product full of all expectations  is a very fast processor  in my case i use it for graphic design  in a nutshell it is spectacular     
1316,2023-12-18,5,59999,the United States,13700K,paired with my 3060ti founders edition  i have yet to run a game that seems like this combo couldn’t handle  apart from gaming it can handle multiple instances of tasks and run them all seamlessly  this is the most powerful cpu i’ve had but it still impresses me how fast everything is and i have not seen its limits yet 
1317,2023-07-19,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i had a 6 year old acer tc 780 desk top with an i7 7700 cpu  due to not able to upgrade to windows 11 and microsoft scheduled to stop supporting windows 10 october 2024  i gave myself a year to shop for a new pc knowing black friday cyber monday have the best prices and deals  i like the gaming rgb astatic and after months of researching online i decided i was going to build my next pc  black friday came early this year thanks to prime day  and msi mag z790 tomahawk mb  and v  color ddr5 oc 7200mhz 32g ram  and msi rtx4070 gpu and the intel i7 13700k all powered from a gamemax 1050w psu  i have a brand new powerful gaming pc that will serve me well in the years to come 
1318,2023-12-03,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i love this chip  fast and efficient also stays cool with my 280mm aio  i had to replace my mb and intel i7 8th gen 8700k so got this over the i9 and could not be happier  wish intel would drop their prices but it is a value for what you get
1319,2023-01-23,5,59999,the United States,13700K,the i7 13700k has i7 12900k performance at an i7 range price range  please note i used an older z690 evga classified board  i was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new cpu yet  i suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard’s vendor manual  the installation was incredibly easy  and i booted the bios after the bios update without any problem  i had hit 5 ghz on the cpu without overclocking  it also supported 6000 mhz ddr5 ram without any issues after enabling xmp  the reasonable pricing for z690 or z790 boards makes the i7 13700k a good combo compared to amd’s expensive ryzen 7000 cpus and motherboard costs  for people who are still on older generations  the vast e cores and p cores offered by intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish cpu intensive tasks like handbrake or adobe premiere  this cpu runs cool with a 360 mm aio and a high airflow case  around 30 36 c idle temperature for me   i also like to note the cpu fits only fits one way and the cpu lever has a bit of tension  so don’t be afraid when installing your cpu 
1320,2023-12-13,4,59999,the United States,13700K,the second purchase of the product  fulfilled its characteristics 
1321,2023-10-03,4,59999,the United States,13700K,i’m sure the chip works beautifully but i had no idea the k series didn’t come with a cooler which is very upsetting for the price point  i now realize very small at the bottom of description it says no thermal cooling  wish it said that in the main details 
1322,2024-02-20,5,59999,the United States,13700K,nothing to say  all is okay
1323,2023-10-16,4,59999,the United States,13700K,fast cpu  did not come with a cpu cooler  make sure you get a good cpu cooler if you play games    this cpu runs very hot if you max it out  recommend water cooler or large air cooled 
1324,2024-01-15,5,59999,the United States,13700K,running in xmp mode  all cores synced  with ram clocked at 7200mhz  no problems whatsoever  runs fast and cool compared to my old 5930k 
1325,2023-01-15,4,59999,the United States,13700K,i got this for a new system build even though a little higher than i like to spend  but it has performed great  after  i noticed a drop in performance and doing research  i found out that these run very very hot and the thermal protection had kicked in to throttle the processor down  i tried a few air cooled options that did the trick  but they were too loud for me  so i ended up with a liquid cooled option which is what i would recommend to anyone using this processor  currently  my idle temps are around 41c and at 100  utilization  temps average around 60 70 with a quick peak of 95  i dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons  but i did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what i did  13th gen blows away 12th gen  this i7 even bests the i9 12th gen  great chip as long as you keep it cool 
1326,2023-08-06,5,59999,the United States,13700K,the i7 runs a bit hotter than the 13th gen i5  but i just couldn t resist spending a bit more for those extra cores  as of 2023  it s a razor fast cpu for the average buyer   probably too powerful for anyone but power users and video editors  as for gaming  it ll run many older games at a high fps even without any help from a gpu  and it handles modern titles without any problems  too   it can run with a low power or stock quality cooler for daily tasks  but i d recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavy duty loads at it  or good performance air cooling if you re planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future 
1327,2023-12-18,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i wanted speed without breaking the bank and this cpu fits the bill  runs a little hot but not too much to handle with an aio water cooler  i use a deepcool lt520   pleased with my build 
1328,2024-02-09,5,59999,the United States,13700K,its great  just buy it  or the 14700k 
1329,2023-12-29,5,59999,the United States,13700K,open box used good condition item  purchased for my wife s latest build    wound up having a better memory controller than my old 13900ks     run really cool 
1330,2023-12-14,5,59999,the United States,13700K,absolutely great cpu  fast  efficient  and perfect for gaming  it’s the ideal cpu for gamers  especially coming from a 9700k  i noticed drastic improvements in my gaming and i highly recommend for others  great buy 
1331,2023-04-06,4,59999,the United States,13700K,if you are looking to get the best gaming experience with the decent price and not getting poor processing power  this is your option  you get the flagship power with lower price than competitor   it is usually huge amount of power however in load  but for person like me keeping oc most of the time  this is where e cores getting into the play   i m not intel fan anymore  i wanted to get amd but because amd requires ddr5 and much expensive for no payback compared to intel  i did choose this  and i m not regretting it   so tl dr  if you are short in budget  and want something last long for next years  get this one fore sure 
1332,2023-09-28,5,59999,the United States,13700K,very impressive cpu almost on par with the i 9 just slightly fewer e cores which if your not an editor or creator of some sort you really won t miss them  gaming wise this cpu has hit all my benchmarks  with a solid score on cinebench time after time  runs a little hot while gaming among other things roughly around 65 to 72°c at highest times  but with the right cooler you will be impressed  does not come with stock cooler  would recommend
1333,2023-07-12,5,59999,the United States,13700K,i replaced a 7th generation i7 cpu with this one  the difference in performance is dramatic  although i the also replaced the mobo  which contributed to the improvement   i may have bought too much cpu power  the asus diagnostics that i run show that the cpu rarely runs at more than 10  of capacity  although i also installed a new gpu so most of the graphics processing is offloaded    installation in the asus motherboard was straightforward  although the socket size has changed from my previous intel cpu  and i had to purchase a new mounting bracket for my cooler  which i did not replace 
1334,2023-11-22,5,59999,the United States,13700K,super fast and stable cpu  note that it can run hot because of the higher voltage it can use  i made sure to get a nice aio for it  coupled with an arctic freeze ii 306 it rarely gets above 30c 
1335,2023-09-19,5,59999,the United States,13700K,it’s insane  the speed you get for its price is absolutely great  it’s granted me a 40  fps increase on baldur’s gate and has helped me in development and lighting in 3d applications  it been stable at 5 4 ghz and is amazing for games  the die is larger than the older cpus due to its newer lga1700 chipset  so i recommend getting the thermalright contact frame  also have a review for it   overall worth it  better if you get it on discount 
1336,2023-11-01,4,59999,the United States,13700K,product is great  delivery was a let down 
1337,2024-01-10,5,59999,the United States,13700K,it is what it is  an action packed cpu
1338,2024-01-17,5,59999,the United States,13700K,nice processor works great  stays cool 
1339,2022-12-07,5,59999,the United States,13700K,above are screenshots of my passmark benchmark  both systems exactly the same  except the first picture has the 13700k and the second picture has the 12700k in it  the rest of the components are hx1200  asus rog maximus hero z690  gskill trident ddr5 f5 6000mhz  adata legend 840 ssd x2 set up in raid 0  vetroo lurker 240mm aio water cooling  power color rx 6900 xt  i run all  p  cores synced at 5300 mhz  temps idle at about 32 to 35c  hard benchmarking takes it up as high as 88 c once  typically about 75c  ordinary gaming  tasking takes it to about 45 to 50c  if you are wondering if its worth the upgrade  it is  but considering that my system is one of the fastest in the world with these components  i would have to say that upgrading to a z790 motherboard is not worth it if you already have a z690  that is all  and good day to you 
1340,2023-12-15,5,59999,the United States,13700K,so i am building my new system starting with i7 13700k upgrading from my pre built alienware i7 9700k it came out incredible and fast  love intel 
1341,2023-04-10,5,59999,the United States,13700K,if you’re looking at this as a gaming only processor  you’ll probably get 95  of the gaming performance this offers with the cheaper and cooler i5 13600k  save your money and put it into a better gpu over buying this because that will actually result in more fps where this processor  over the 13600k  will not   that being said  this processor is a monster  it’s a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up  most stable and speedy system i’ve ever owned  13th gen might have come out before ryzen 7000 series  but i still think it’s the winner   ek’s nucleus 360mm aio did a great job at keeping this cpu under control 
1342,2023-07-17,4,59999,the United States,13700K,upgraded from asus prime z390 a  i7 9700k  to asus rog strix z790 1 wifi d4  i7 13700k   using noctua nh u12a air cooler  temperatures around 60 c when gaming  with spikes around 75 c  most users report this processor tends to run hot  i have not stress tested but have heard reports of throttling when under extreme  not typical user  load  overall happy with the choice 
1343,2023-10-15,4,59999,the United States,13700K,good intel cpu but overpriced  good graphics with intel 770 uhd 
1344,2023-04-23,5,59999,the United States,13700K,this was the first generation 13 processor we used in a build  of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that  our test show it is about 9  faster than its same numbered 12th generation  the other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs 13th the newer processor appears to run about 2° 3° c lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions  all in all  obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can t see justification for anyone taking their i9 12900k out and installing i9 13900k  the gains would probably not be really experienced 
1345,2024-04-02,5,82350,India,13900K,cool processor
1346,2023-10-13,5,82350,India,13900K,this processor is all rounder for every tasks you do on pc from small to cpu intensive applications  if you are looking for vast performance with heavy production tasks this is very nice to have  best to use with motherboard ddr5 and pci e 5 0 supported motherboards 
1347,2023-08-24,5,82350,India,13900K,the intel core i9 13900k is an absolute powerhouse  its blazing speeds and unrivaled performance have transformed my computing experience  multitasking is a breeze  and demanding applications run seamlessly  the advanced technology and impressive efficiency make it a must have for any tech enthusiast  truly a 5 star gem   i recommend this cpu for 8k gaming and stream 
1348,2023-11-10,3,82350,India,13900K,it is working almost same as my 10 yr old dell xps laptop  swapped with a sata ssd  and i7 second gen processor  i don t know whats improved  but it s doing its job i guess   in my 2 weeks of usage i have seen it s temprature rised above 80°c once  wasn t expecting that from current refined and powerful generations  i am using liquid cooling on top of this  and yet it hit 80°c  what i was doing when that happened was trying to open a game  and one thing that i missed was to disable the integrated graphics because i have dedicated gpu  it was just for a moment the cpu was used during the game launch and after it started using the gpu  but until that switch happened  under less than a minute of cpu usage  it reached to 80°c  i mean since these are premium products  there should be some protection layers blocking such usages  and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance   but anyways  i disabled the integrated device and then it s all smooth  everything normal except for that one instance explained above  parallel processing is still shitty though with windows os  same kind of processors on mac before apple silicon came in were working more efficiently  so i guess it s prob with windows os  but not processors 
1349,2022-12-05,5,82350,India,13900K,nice processor good performance good over clocking nice performance takes loads getting god fps in all games like gta5 etc
1350,2023-03-26,5,82350,Australia,13900K,good
1351,2024-05-13,2,82350,the Netherlands,13900K,it s not amazon s issue but the processor i bought is faulty  i m experiencing crashes while playing games  it s so annoying and so time consuming  i had so many stressful moments because of this 
1352,2024-06-10,5,82350,Canada,13900K,a monster  i built a gigantic computer of madmen and this processor can hardly undergo stress a monster construction and it can take everything that clashes 
1353,2023-10-05,5,82350,Brazil,13900K,play video after over 10 years with a core i7 i decided to upgrade for this processor and it is amazing 
1354,2024-05-03,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i love it  works great  i paired this with 128gb using g skill ripjaws s5 series  intel xmp 3 0  ddr5 ram 64gb  2x32gb  5600mt s cl28 34 34 89 1 35v desktop computer memory udimm   matte black  f5 5600j2834f32gx2 rs5k   this is the fasted 5600 mt s ddr5 i could find on amazon at the time of purchase and i specifically chose the 5600 mt s because as it is advertised on intel s website for the i9 13900k  it works really good  very very fast  and can    multi task heavy software like they re nothing    and with a push pull aio it averages around 28 c and when i m gaming it stays around 50 40 c with graphics maxed out  much love and gratitude to intel  this works great with gaming and also data science  which work is the main reason i bought this  i also used the thermal grizzly   kryosheet  38x38x0 2mm  for this as well so i don t have to worry about paste drying up on my i9  3 and lemmy tell you it fits perfectly and pairs well with a cpu contact frame too  and after almost half a year i ve yet to have any problems  only good results 
1355,2023-08-02,3,82350,France,13900K,torn parcel  it looks like you have sought to see the interior we will see at editing
1356,2023-11-20,5,82350,Italy,13900K,nothing to say about this little monster i highly recommend buying the 13 series and not the 14  the last really pacifier too much current     i went from the i9 14900k to 13900k for this thing
1357,2023-05-06,1,82350,the United Kingdom,13900K,after 3 months it appeared that my processor is faulty  i discussed the issue with intel support and they happily agreed to replace it with a new one  but i still had to discuss this with the reseller  they have a very bad support and hardly answer my messages time to time with short sentences

1361,2023-03-31,5,82350,Mexico,13900K,i changed my system of an 11th generation processor to this generation 13  i use it mainly to decode video  which does so in a quarter of the time with respect to the previous one  the only problem is that it does not bring a fan  and it is heatedtoo too  if you want to make overclock a lot of processing power  but you will require a dissipated with enough capacity to cool it  not anyone will serve you
1362,2024-06-10,5,82350,Canada,13900K,excellent product
1363,2024-05-22,5,82350,Canada,13900K,in my opinion it is the best processor to gamer    
1364,2023-04-24,1,82350,the United Kingdom,13900K,don’t buy from this seller  this company sells faulty products  the courier charge to return the faulty product to usa is very expensive  
1365,2023-09-12,5,82350,Mexico,13900K,everything came well i really liked product packaging very good 
1366,2023-12-13,5,82350,the United States,13900K,so i am no tech guru or anything  i cannot delve into the technical nuances of this cpu like some can  what i can tell you is this  the i9 13900k has significantly increased my productivity  being able to run multiple cpu heavy applications completely changed the way i work  yes i know this cpu runs notoriously hot  but it seems a good quality aio tames it well  i have the 13900k running on an gigabyte z790 aorus master x motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and i use the nzxt kraken 360 elite to cool it  the kraken elite does manage the heat well and my systems idles at 28 29 degrees  this cpu is way overkill for a gamer  but for someone like me that does a lot of 3d modeling and rendering  its great  i do have the cpu slightly overclocked using the intel extreme tuning utility in automatic overclock  i have not had any crashes and havent noticed any thermal throttling at all with this setup

1370,2024-02-20,5,82350,Canada,13900K,i bought an identical 1 year ago and it worked very well until a month ago for i don t know what reason he stopped working and i had to replace it for the moment  it works well hoping that it will last last more than a year this time have i only been unlucky or is there a problem with this cpu       
1371,2022-12-27,5,82350,Japan,13900K,we were considering operations using silent cpu fans  noctua nh d15   but it exceeded 100 degrees if we continued to apply high load by introducing simple water cooling  celsius s36   you can maintain 80 degrees even if it is high if you are considering air cooling  be careful geekbench 5 score single core score  2164 multi core score  21335
1372,2023-01-31,5,82350,Japan,13900K,you can afford air  cooled  a cooler of about 5000 yen of thermal light  by just playing with the voltage a little it is around 80 degrees even if the load is applied for about 10 minutes it hardly gets hot in a game r23 bench score is about 37 000 due to voltage restriction  but it does not have an effect because it is used by the way  if it is water  cooled  it will be a little more voltage  so it will be about 40 000 the lga1700 had a cpu sled problem  but i chewed a thin washer on the screw part of the socket  applied the light and a ruler  but there was no problem at all 
1373,2023-02-27,5,82350,Mexico,13900K,i would wait for the new lake meteor to come out if someone is thinking about buying it in 2023  either to buy meteor lake or to wait for it to go down a little price
1374,2024-03-14,5,82350,Canada,13900K,this thing is a beast  i don t even need to overclock it  it s amazing how fast it can actually do everything i throw at it  3d rendering  zipping folders  unreal engine 5 0 works  installing big softwares  anything  add a liquid cooling system and this thing will do anything you ask it to without problems 
1375,2024-05-16,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i’m running a 360 aio  under volted  idle temp 25°c underload it doesn’t get above 60c  renders out projects really fast

1378,2024-05-31,3,82350,Canada,13900K,we set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday   to make a long story short  we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7 11th gen we had from before   the surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines  we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others  we hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the cpus and was shocked that this one was drawing 450w as others were showing   200w  and temperature went up to 100c while the others were at 70c   one system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy  it would reboot  we determined the problem was that psu only supported  12v rail at 20a  we switched to a 600w psu that supports  12v  50a and it worked flawlessly  so watch out that your psu supplies sufficient amps at  12v   ordered a replacement  replacement brand new would not boot up  we swapped back old cpu from  and it boots up but runs hot again  this one we had to reduce workload to 75  of other systems to cool it down   so 2 out of 10 desktops are defective this is a huge surprise  these systems had no gpu  only motherboard  64gb of ddr5  and an ssd  has anyone else seen this 
1379,2024-03-22,4,82350,the United States,13900K,got it for my gaming machines  but all my games crashes when trying to play 
1380,2023-12-29,4,82350,the United States,13900K,this cpu unit is a beast  upgraded from a i7 8700k   the improvement was huge  doubled my fps in wow  and there is no more lag  nevertheless  after 6 months of regular use  it started failing   many kernel errors until it finally became useless  i could  somehow  return it to intel  from perú to usa   great support outside us   but such a complex and expensive unit cannot fail that quickly without heavy usage  at least in my opinion 
1381,2023-02-22,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i got this and a new ddr5 motherboard with z690 chipset  it didn t boot when i set it all up  it turns out the z690 needs a bios update to work with this cpu  luckily i had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard  i dropped it in and it booted  then i did the bios update  after that it boots this cpu just fine  before this i was a die hard amd supporter  i had 5950x with 16 cores  32 threads  and 72mb of cache  but  it just doesn t compete with this i9  i haven t tried the 7950x  but i read that the p cores just blow away the amd cores  even with less cache  the setup of 8 performance cores  and 16 efficiency cores just works  it stays much cooler than earlier i9 s and the amd  i use a water cooler  but it s not required  nothing slows this down when paired with ddr5  i wish the amd was better  i like the company more  but  i want the best of the best  and as of today there is nothing better than this available  if you game  or do graphics  or anything on your pc this is the cpu for you  it will not disappoint   a word on the x790 chipset  you would think they will have better performance because they are newer  they don t  they will work with the i9 no matter what  while the z690 might need a bios update  they have one more usb port  but otherwise there is no benefit to getting z790 and they cost a lot more  so  if you have the ability to use an older cpu to flash the bios  or find one that is new enough that it doesn t need the update  this cpu will be great 
1382,2023-11-14,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i really like this cpu and it has worked well for my needs  many had the issue of overheating  throttling and even bending in some instances  i have not experienced any of this since i knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the bios to keep this monster cpu running cool  it seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues  all you need to to is look up the specs for your cpu and setup the bios of your motherboard accordingly   i am using the aorus waterforce x 280 with artic mx 6 thermal paste just in case you are curious  this has also been installed on the gigabyte z790 aorus elite ax motherboard   as long as you set this up correctly you will not have any issues and will get a great performing cpu 
1383,2024-02-05,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i did end up returning it because of a motherboard issue  i do have a 12900k  and many other types and they all perform as expected  i would recommend intel processors to those looking for something for general all around performance  as the 14900k and 13900k are basically the same  i would say get this one unless you can find the 14900k for the same price 
1384,2023-09-28,4,82350,the United States,13900K,using phantek glacier d30 360mm cooler  during heavy stress load it gets around 82 84c  just gaming in heavy modded skyrim  ffxiv  and total warhammer 3 stays around 50 55c   those complaining about temps higher than that while just gaming likely do not have their cooler mounted properly or too low end of a cooler   make sure coolers plastic film is removed from metal block if it has that  apply plenty of thermal paste if cooler doesnt come pre applied with any  and evenly screw on the mounting screws to keep pressure as evenly as possible till all are set 
1385,2023-09-19,5,82350,the United States,13900K,when it comes to going over the top for a pc upgrade  this cpu is the undisputed heavyweight champion  i  too  dabble in video editing  3d modeling  and an array of demanding tasks  and let me tell you  this powerhouse just devours them with sheer gusto  paired with a kraken water cooler  it operates like a well oiled machine  showing absolutely no signs of throttling  even under the most intense workloads  and as for those so called  cpu intensive  games  well  they might as well be child s play for this beast  if you re seeking the best of the best  look no further – this cpu is the crown jewel in the kingdom of processors  and it s here to make your computing dreams come true  it s not just top tier  it s top of the world  and it laughs in the face of anything you throw its way  a true marvel of technology that s worth every penny 
1386,2023-08-10,5,82350,the United States,13900K,this processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card  i can edit videos and play games both at 4k settings together no problem and it doesn’t generate that much heat either  i previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4k so sadly i had to retire my old build  just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090  don’t be a smartass and try to put it in small case  you will regret it later  i personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don’t want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent  good luck gamers and editors  just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor  amd processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do 
1387,2024-02-16,5,82350,the United States,13900K,this is a beast of a cpu this thing destroys anything you can throw at it can download surf the net while gaming and it doesnt bat a eye and she runs much cooler than the tubers are showing turn your volts to 1 37v and done  amazing power    
1388,2023-05-15,5,82350,the United States,13900K,it’s so good  and that makes sense since it’s top of the line right now  imagine that   going from my 9900k to this was like a spiritual enlightening but also i must add this is totally unnecessary unless you’ll be working with heavy loads  unreal engine  4k video editing and streaming  4k gaming  or anything that requires overclocking   buying this bad boy will future proof your computer for now  but there are very few people who need this kind of cpu  if you’re shopping for your build right now and considering this  if it’s in the budget and you want something that’ll handle literally whatever you want then yes  this is great  but just remember  whatever you want might not be as intense as this thing accounts for   now that i’ve warned you about not needing this  let me just say how happy i am that i got it  i do a lot of 4k editing and streaming and there is no issue  runs smoothly and efficiently  does get hot though  if you’ve got a good cooler on this then you’ll be good to go for a long time 
1389,2023-02-24,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i bought two of these from amazon after one from another vendor failed to post  both worked the first time  do you need 24 cores for games  most games use 4 or 6 cores max  so probably not  video editing can benefit from the extra cores  intel supports xmp  extreme memory profile  and this processor is unlocked  it can be overclocked   overclocking increases the power consumption and heat  therefore  one needs a robust cooling solution  overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the intel extreme tuning utility  i have the nzxt kraken x 73 rgb liquid cooler  with the nzxt cam software you can see the cpu  and gpu  temperatures and control the fan speeds  reducing the risk of damaging the processor  while idling  at 5 5 ghz  the cpu temperature is 30 c  under a 50  load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 c  pros  good for video editing cons  a bit pricey for a gaming computer  don t overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 c 
1390,2024-02-05,5,82350,the United States,13900K,installation is easy  it does run a little hot so you need a good cooler  i use a dedicated all in one water solution from corsair  and the package temp never exceeds 75 
1391,2023-12-25,5,82350,the United States,13900K,as per benchmarks  this cpu performs way better than amd 7950x3d  although  you will just get 3 4 frames higher while gaming in amd 7950x3d cpu but what s the point  intel is still leading in single core score  power consumption is almost same  intel is apple and amd is android  end of story 
1392,2023-03-11,4,82350,the United States,13900K,this thing puts enough heat out to power a thermal generator  and i really am not kidding  water cooling only unless you want to melt your board or destroy the high dollar part  i would also recommend a large radiator too  3 fan coverage  this thing is an excellent space heater   outclasses thread ripper by almost double its paces per benchmarking in multicore  handles everything i throw at it then yawns at me as if it was boring and mediocre work   simply put  leader of the pack right now and handles literally anything i’ve tried to hit it with  even running multiple games at once  when combined with a good gpu  naturally    i have zero complaints  i’ve learned to hate a lot of intel items over the years  but this truly is a marvel 
1393,2024-02-12,5,82350,the United States,13900K,the delivery went well and arrived on time  the product conforms and meets my needs 
1394,2024-03-02,5,82350,the United States,13900K,excellent product
1395,2023-05-29,5,82350,the United States,13900K,excellent processor  it is a beast in gaming and in productivity  for the price i believe is unrivaled  beware that you should separately buy a cpu cooler because it does not come with one  also beware that most motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the bios  so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit  for example i m using an 360mm aio cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my aorus elite ax when running cinebench it reaches 100°c within 12 seconds of starting  of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games  there  the max i ve seen the cpu get is 67°c  but is something to be aware of  all in all happy with this beast
1396,2023-10-04,5,82350,the United States,13900K,probably more than what i need for gaming  maybe i should have gotten a 13700k instead to run a little cooler  this gets hot on my dark rock pro 4  i want to get a 360mm aio to help cool this  i ruined a motherboard trying to use a contact frame  afraid to use one again  contact frame went in the trash  so another motherboard would not  using the stock cpu holder  loading mechanism 
1397,2023-06-28,5,82350,the United States,13900K,if it have the money to spare and want a processor that ll last you at least 5 years  and are a power user like i am  its a good choice  but most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren t worth it to most users   if you re just using the pc as a high end gaming rig an i7 13700k is more than enough even with a 4090 gpu  this processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so i d save the 150  and get the cheaper 13700k  also this processor is notoriously hot  so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm  watercooler aio is necessary  especially for overclocking  
1398,2024-02-07,5,82350,the United States,13900K,run smoothly and cool  great value
1399,2023-07-02,1,82350,the United States,13900K,it worked fine for 6 months  then i start running into error code 0xc0000005 with lots of various applications in windows 11  i figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing  and i dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues  i reset the os  still issues  i do a fresh clean install  still issues  i try replacing the memory  still issues  i try installing win 11 with a different boot installer  still issues  i try windows 10     still issues  i try reinstalling it 2 more times  still the same issue   i decide to go to micro center to have them diagnose the issue  while i am there  their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code  they take it in  and in 2 days message me saying its the cpu  they tried the cpu in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up  so  i go and pick up the machine   i try to file a warrenty claim with intel  but their login system was broken for a week  so i had to chat with a support person  we spend 1 hour typing about the issue  i send him screenshots of the cpu itself  the text from microcenter  the recepit from amazon  screenshot of the bios showing all my hardware information  a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter  a screenshot of the error code   i wait a week or so  i can finally log into intel website  and i dont see a support ticket  i open up chat again  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address  they assign it and forward the support response to me   and the response says  they cant contact microcenter to confirm it  and that its not a cpu issue anyways because that code is due to an os issue   an os issue  i ask them to reiterate their point  because if its an os issue  that means they dont believe me and microcenter  i also pointed out again that i have installed windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times     and they respond with  i need documentation from microcenter  so  they dont believe me and they believe this is an os issue still   it has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless i send the documentation from micro center now   works great  but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky 
1400,2023-09-28,5,82350,the United States,13900K,if youre going with an aio get a 360mm cooler  i tried using a 240mm and it just wasnt enough to cool the cpu during some starfield  that out of the way  this thing is seriously impressive  even with how un optimized some of these new games are  i have never seen anything use it beyond 80  other than some cpu specific tasks 
1401,2024-01-22,5,82350,the United States,13900K,it works as intended  needed the upgrade 
1402,2022-11-28,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i9 13900k or kf  fast install onto a supermicro board x13sae f with server memory with ipmi for remote access or an asus board such as z690 f with ddr5 where you can buy an ipmi attachment  and it throttles rather than crashes when it overheats  or just for gaming and office use this cpu beats everything else to date  buy one now and if you have an i9 12900k or kf sell it  pay attention to the necessary new bios install  not one crash to date but occasional throttling down when stressed as cpu temperature gets too high occurs now and again but not very often and sure stronger air fan or water cool fix that if it bothers you  same thing happens on my more than twice the price thread ripper 3970x and not a big deal  this a server class cpu 
1403,2023-02-07,5,82350,the United States,13900K,the intel core i9 13900k desktop processor is just a fantastic super fast processor that does have 24 cores when needed for heavy applications  get yourself an aio cooler like the artic freezer ii 360 size and you re all set  no real need to overclock this cpu  it also works great for heavy applications and gaming  has plenty of fast l 3 cache on die so there s no delay or speed issues  it also runs my team group ddr 5 7800mhz ram with no problem on my maximus z790 hero chipset motherboard  wanted to get the evga z790 kingpin motherboard but it sells out very fast within minutes  great cpu and i m very happy that i ve bought the intel 13900k  hands down  this will be a great for 5 6 years to easily and maybe longer 
1404,2024-02-18,5,82350,the United States,13900K,play video very gooood
1405,2023-06-06,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i had an issue with my computer not posting and after taking it to best buy for a diagnostic report  i was told that my motherboard or cpu was bad  i sent both back  turns out it was the motherboard not the cpu that was the issue  even though they are entitled to up to 20 or so percent as a stocking fee they were generous enough to give me a full refund  i appreciate this kind of service and hope you wont hesitate to reach out if you have an issue 
1406,2023-01-02,4,82350,the United States,13900K,it comes with cpu only in a box   without a fan  so you need to buy an lga1700 fan support  it running quit good  but not the greatest yet for rtx 4090  4080  because the gpu usage will reach 95 98  it doesn t go  99 all the times so there s a bit of cpu bottleneck even at 4k resolution   it gets even worst cpu bottleneck in 1440p or 1080p  so i think the core i9 14900k or 15900k will get the job done no cpu bottleneck  i used this with asus rog strix z790 f gaming ddr5 it works great  thanks to the seller is trusted 
1407,2023-03-13,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i can t believe the price for what this thing does  i do photography  video and graphics  not sure i will ever use its full potential  with water cooling this thing runs super cool  considering my last computer was a quad core   well  i should be future proof for a very long time   intel i9 13900k corsair icue h150i rgb elite liquid cpu cooler asus tuf gaming z 790 plus wi fi corsair rmx series rm850x 850 watt psu asus tuf gaming geforce rtx 3070 ti oc v2 32gb corsair vengance ddr5 5600 1tb samsung 980 pro gen 4 gaming nvme   system 2tb samsung 980 pro gen 4 gaming nvme – data antec p20ce case 2x asus proart 24 1  monitors
1408,2023-12-26,2,82350,the United States,13900K,took me forever to figure this out  but i can t reach rated speeds on my 13900k due to throttling   sp 111 88   103 cooling  170  when the throttle happens  both p cores and e cores drop  causing performance hits in normal tasks as well as games  asus motherboard at default settings attempts to send extreme amounts of voltage to the cpu  1 4   in order to reach boost rating  no xmp    this has literally been the most difficult processor to reign in heat i ve had to deal with in my 30 years of computing  amd is starting to look good i guess  which is why i switched to and have remained with intel for 20 years  amd ran hot back in the day   apparently even the 14900k s are having issues   it s power hungry it s hot not enough surface area to cool appropriately without risking your warranty  literally every solution i ve seen involves doing things intel recommends against   intel  some help would be appreciated 
1409,2023-06-04,5,82350,the United States,13900K,this cpu is insanely fast for both gaming  but also productivity  right out of the box with default settings  my 13900k scored over 40000 points on cinebench r23 multicore test  for max power uses like cinebench or blender  it pushes my 360mm aio cooler to it s limits  but for gaming it rarely gets above 60 c  i use a thermalrite contact frame  and thermal grizzly kryonaut paste for max cooling effectiveness  overall  very pleased with my purchase and plan to use this cpu for many years to come 
1410,2023-06-19,5,82350,the United States,13900K,installed on my full white build with asus rog maximus z690 formula works without any problems  i had the bios 2103 now 2403 works flawlessly  it s fast but i noticed a little more on the hot side i get 35 45 idle and 50 60 during mw2  i have the nzxt z73 cooler   first time i ran aida64 it failed saying hardware failure  second and consecutive times it ran at 80ish but below 90
1411,2023-09-23,5,82350,the United States,13900K,well  what can i tell you  it is simply the best processor of 2023  you have to have an idea of ​​what you are going to use it for  it is a big beast that is not worth it for small fights 
1412,2023-07-17,5,82350,Canada,13900K,play video this cpu will give you all the juice you need for that sweet ultra 4k gaming i recommend either a noctua dh 15 as air cooling solution for this cpu since it can run hit under heavy load i dont recommend an aio but i do recommend a custom loop if you know what you are doing its very worth for this cpu other than this have fun gamers
1413,2023-08-30,4,82350,the United States,13900K,hot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1414,2023-12-01,5,82350,the United States,13900K,it is very agile and for its amount of nuclei very fast 
1415,2023-11-30,5,82350,the United States,13900K,bought it for gaming  it does what i need 
1416,2023-08-23,5,82350,the United States,13900K,it s great  24 cores 32 processors  i was able to spin up about 6 different virtual machines with no lag 4 cores each  or delay on switching between each virtual machine and on dual monitor   the best of the best for a reason 
1417,2023-04-09,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i had i core7 7700k 7ge  so i changed some components because they were already 5 years old  and i wanted to update to windows 11 so i had to changed the cpu so i decided for this i9 of course i had to changed then the motherboard the memory the cpu cooler and the case the rest was fine to work with the new components  now my pc it’s like a beast so fast and powerful with the 990 pro  i love it…
1418,2023-10-02,5,82350,the United States,13900K,this cpu works great with the msi hero z790 mobo  coupled with a msi meg coreliquid aio cpu cooler i dont have any issues with the amount of heat this i9 puts out 
1419,2023-12-15,5,82350,the United States,13900K,reliable speedy productivity gaming cpu
1420,2023-03-28,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i use it for computation  not games  with a noctua d15  1 fan   on all cores  some openmp stuff i wrote  it goes 5 1ghz on the performance cores and 4 1ghz on the efficient cores  in a 23c corner of a room   the temp moves between 90 and 100 c  how i handle that  emotionally  is to have enough in my bank account to get a 13600k overnighted  having said that  i ve been at it for a little over a month and there has not been a glitch  paired with an asus strix 790 e 
1421,2023-05-01,5,82350,the United States,13900K,i seriously doubt i’ll be replacing this in the next several years  if even that  this thing is a beast and handles everything you throw at it   i’ve put it through all of the usual hoops and it barely seems to notice  i’ve set it up with the arctic liquid freezer ii 420 a rgb to deal with the heat and it handles that just fine   worth your time and money  not a bad choice at all 
1422,2023-03-01,4,82350,the United States,13900K,this processor produces too much heat  forget obout overclocking  i tried intel utility   in overclocked mode the processor consumes over 300w and heats to over 100c even with the best cooler  without overclocking it consumes about 250w and heats up to 89c under the full load  which is acceptable  
1423,2022-11-23,5,82350,the United States,13900K,have been using this for less than a week  amazing cpu  easy to install in your motherboard  package appears more simpler compared to older model   question  do you want an over built  beast of a cpu that you will likely not use to its full potential  but want the best of the best and your willing to pay a small premium compared to the slower model  but you re not some simp that wants something good but wants to dominate and laugh because you re cpu is better than all the ones out there  if the answer is yes  than please get this 
1424,2023-08-03,3,82350,the United States,13900K,built my new pc  thermals on the chip were high  over 100°c when benchmarking  kept shutting down the system  trouble shot my mobo aio bios for a couple days  rralized it was a hot chip or a bad heat sensor in it  got the new one today  81°c uder full load  never know what ur gunna get  now i get to wait 30 days for my money back  at least its sorted 
1425,2023-03-15,5,82350,the United States,13900K,just installed this in my new build and i have to say it is amazing  my one warning to anyone inexperienced with the newer cpus is be prepared for the heat  after a lot of work i was finally able to get this down to an average of 30   40 degrees fahrenheit during light loads  when under a heavy load such as cyberpunk at max everything at 4k  i get about 70   79 degrees fahrenheit  this beast is hot  but utterly incredible in its performance 
1426,2023-10-25,2,59100,India,14700K,what s the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but i think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5   uplift for 15   more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money
1427,2023-10-23,5,59100,India,14700K,beast gaming world 2nd most powerful processor my set up has this processor and rtx 4070 16gb ram 2048gb 2tb  nvme m 2 ssd 850 watts pls buy it
1428,2024-04-19,5,59100,Japan,14700K,since 7700k does not support windows11  i chose this because i had to build a new pc soon i ve used i7 with k until now  so i did that again even though 7700k is 91w of power consumption  this is 253w  and the centerpiece popped out the 7700k was cool enough with toru  but it seemed impossible  and the cooler chose deepcool s ak620 if the power limit is applied to 125w  it will settle to about 70 degrees  and it seems to be usable with confidence if the grease is applied appropriately  it will be a little lower although it is an important feeling of use  there is 28 cores including logical cores  so there is a sense of security that it will not be heavy even if you do a good work considering my usage  it is an overspec  but it is better to be relieved to buy a high performance and buy enough than regret that the performance is not enough later i am the reason i keep buying i7 is this sense of security it is also an advantage for me that power restrictions are needed normally  if you limit 125w  it will lead to a sense of security that you can cancel the limit in an emergency  i will not come in case of emergency  i know  i7 also buy sufficient security i think it was 
1429,2023-12-08,5,59100,Japan,14700K,use it for the first time 240mm can cool down with simple water cooling 
1430,2024-01-18,5,59100,Canada,14700K,arrived earlier than expected  a very good cpu  expansive but what could we do 
1431,2023-12-10,4,59100,Japan,14700K,the previous cpu is 4790k of 4 generations  so it is 10th generation is it just the right performance among 14 generations 
1432,2024-03-24,5,59100,Germany,14700K,with sufficient cooling  there is also about 60 degrees in gaming operation 
1433,2024-05-31,5,59100,the United States,14700K,i decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn t justify the price difference  considering i was already getting about 1 3 more performance than my 12th generation i9  i wanted plenty of motherboard resources so i also bought the msi meg z790 ace  32 gb of kingston fury 6400mt s ddr5 and a 2tb samsung 990 nvme drive   cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9  even with a 360mm aio cooler  so i went custom loop  along the way i found a gpu water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling  the thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators  but i wanted some disks  so i went for a 560x140 and a 280x140  both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans  four more fans feed air into the case and there s till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in   so what s the result  the processor runs at 85c worst case  and only two cores at that temperature  the fast ddr5 does make a significant difference  i initially ran it at 6gt s then turned it up to 6 2 and finally 6 4  the last change is a 3 5  change in ddr5 speed and that gave me a 2 4  increase in system speed  i kept my old rtx3070 which used to run over 80c and now runs at 62c worst case  so despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler   i mostly run x plane 12  which runs the gpu and cpu very hard  continuously  after several hours the cooling water reached 36c and the worst core temperature was 85c  the processor just works  no stability issues with the standard settings on the msi z690 motherboard  there are three standard memory tuning options for 6 0  6 2  and 6 4 gt s and all work  this will do for me for a few years 
1434,2024-06-02,4,59100,the United States,14700K,this processor is a speed demon  gaming  editing  encoding  and whatever else you can think of  it can handle  the performance is there  the value for money is quite good too  unless you really want top of the line  this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration  20 cores  8p and 12e  boost up to 5 6ghz on 2 threads  i swapped a 12600k for this part and i m still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps  this is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower  i wouldn t consider building new with it however   there s a cost to this cpu though  heat  and power draw  i have an arctic liquid freezer iii 360 aio on this chip  and even with a sizable undervolt  it still throttles at around 230w running 100c  it feels like this chip is almost uncoolable  unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something  i considered a large air cooler for this chip and i m glad i went with an aio  buyer beware  this thing runs hot  it s also incredibly fast  if you can cool it this thing will fly 
1435,2024-05-03,4,59100,the United States,14700K,i upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later  performance wise  the difference is fairly negligible to me  and that is reflected in the  real  specs  going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x  increase when most of those cores are  efficiency cores   user benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47  faster than the 8700k  despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart   the main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle casual power use  my ups tells me that for my 8700k 1070ti system i drew  0 43 kw  and my new 14700k 4070ti super draws  0 31 kw watching yt  browsing the web  includes fans  monitors  etc    mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card  since that s what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway  ai image generation training   gpu  video rendering editing transcoding   gpu  even audio processing correction is done on gpu these days 
1436,2024-06-13,5,59100,the United States,14700K,still love intel despite their lack of anything groundbreaking recently  cpu’s still work great for gaming  this one included  works right out the box and went perfect with my new msi motherboard too 
1437,2024-05-31,5,59100,the United States,14700K,i was able to get 240fps in cs go and valorant without external gpu  i previously had 6th gen i7 and gtx980  and that couldn t pull this  lightroom rendering is also good i am able to color correct 100 raw pics in seconds  i didn t expect this performance when i updated 
1438,2024-05-01,5,59100,the United States,14700K,switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super   this is one heck of a cpu  i only put a  60 280mm aio  i d cooling  and put it on smart fan  after that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99  gpu usage in every game  jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on  which is unheard of from everything i read  totally glad i went with this over 7800x3d  mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle i wanted  my newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling   thanks to this cpu at its core 
1439,2024-04-05,5,59100,the United States,14700K,upgrading from a 10700kf to 14700k  lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but i’m here to tell you it’s well worth the money  just make sure to go to your bios and limit the power to 253w  the whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion  i haven’t gotten heat issues while gaming   overall i have this chip paired with a 3090  while i’ll wait for a new 50 series card   some of the gains i’ve gotten at  1440p  45 in ultra wide 21 9  max graphics settings   overwatch  overall 50fps gain  consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor  black desert online  overall 35 40 fps gains   these are the games i normally play a lot and it’s truly notice when upgrading to this chip  overall the computer is a snappy and fast and haven’t notice any hiccups  really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4 5 years 
1440,2024-05-08,4,59100,the United States,14700K,i m using this as a server cpu mostly for the sr iov capable gpu stability has been an issue when running windows vm s on proxmox but in light of recent news about mainboard mfg s pushing the cpu too hard out of the box that may be the source of my stability issues as i mostly left the settings oob for the cpu
1441,2024-05-20,5,59100,the United States,14700K,this 14th generation intel core i7 is a powerful and fantastic processor for a desktop gaming build  the product is well packaged with some assembly instructions that are easy to follow  i heartily recommend this computer processor for diys and computer enthusiasts 
1442,2024-05-12,5,59100,the United States,14700K,upgraded my pc from a 8700k to this bad boy  exceptional speeds and performance  temps are good and tasks are loading super fast  
1443,2024-05-24,5,59100,the United States,14700K,works as advertised 
1444,2024-05-06,5,59100,the United States,14700K,this intel 14700k is phenomenal  lightning fast speeds and seamless performance make every task a breeze  whether i m gaming  streaming  or working  it handles everything with ease 
1445,2024-05-15,5,59100,the United States,14700K,this is kinda good for my gpu
1446,2024-01-03,5,59100,the United States,14700K,i guess everyone is right  these things are hot and then some  i went with a off brand aio  and for the most part i m good  it does get spicy when i m rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking   gaming seems fine  no issues  i play all kinds of games  fps  mmo s  survival  etc   paired with a gigabyte gaming 4090 oc  tforce 64 gigs 6000 m t ddr5  samsung 990 pro nvme 2 tb x2  no ocing done by me    i replaced a 5950x  which was having issues for some reason  just felt like it was getting slower and slower  thermal paste and heat were fine on it  never got over 60c with the beefier aio i had on it  just took longer and longer to render things  i guess i wore it out   i just think you ll want a good aio  and or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it  i m not sure a air cooled option will do you any good  but hey i ve been wrong many times  so there might be something that can handle the job   all in all  not bad  but it s not going to give you much performance boost over last gen  matter of fact i found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests  blargh  either way  its fast  and it runs everything great  so i m happy till the next go around 
1447,2023-12-29,4,59100,the United States,14700K,i was never a fan of intel s business models of locking off cores features to try and upsell the features back to the consumer         that aside  intel has always been the leader in the cpu market and while amd has been making strides in recent years intel is still the go to for reliability and power   anyway     if you have money to burn and need to upgrade due to artificial obsolesces that is the new craze of forcing people to upgrade     well  this processor will last a long time    or until they just decide it s not capable anymore 
1448,2023-12-31,5,59100,the United States,14700K,very good processor  upgraded form a very nice ryzen 1700  6 years old with me  to this one  decided to go intel due to memory stability  after 3 weeks i can say i love it  very nice temps while gaming and i ve received around a 60  improvement in my games  i maintained my rtx3070   i m currently using a nzxt kraken elite 360 aio to cool it and it has been showing around 50 60 c during high intensive gaming which is very good  went with this over the 7800x3d since i feel this is more future proof for productivity since i upgrade every 5 6 years  while i know the am5 socket will last longer  anyways  every time i upgrade i also upgrade the motherboard  very nice product  will recommend it 
1449,2024-02-17,4,59100,the United States,14700K,greaaaaaat  but lacking in presentation 
1450,2023-11-17,5,59100,the United States,14700K,was going to wait until 15th gen to upgrade my 10900k but decided to go for it  while the 10900k is still a powerhouse this is a good upgrade and i am happy with  this processor is ridiculously fast and handles everything we would expect it to  cyberpunk picked up 10fps with a 3080 but runs super smooth now at 4k with rt  i did pair this with a z790 aorus and 32gb ddr5 6400            at own risk        suggest undervolting in bios if you know what you are doing  i am running this cpu 5 7 all cores   1 24v on a custom loop  i see idle temps 31c   gaming 60c and cinebench 89c  it will run hot if you re on air and do not adjust the default voltage  there are plenty of youtube videos out there as a resource  overall great processor
1451,2024-03-28,5,59100,the United States,14700K,this new intel® core™ i7 14700k new gaming desktop processor with 20 cores just rocks  cooling it with an noctua nh u12a  premium cpu cooler with high performance quiet nf a12x25 pwm fans  120mm  brown  for desktop 
1452,2024-03-15,5,59100,Germany,14700K,haven t installed yet but looks fine  die size is 30x40 mm  meaning 0 3 ml 0 8 g is the perfect amount of thermal paste  not included   i ll put 5 dots 
1453,2023-10-26,4,59100,the United States,14700K,i upgraded from a12700k with asus tuf z690 board and a arctic air 360 aio  the 12700 k ran at about 50°c gaming the 14700k runs in the mid 60s  the 12700k cinebench score and temp was 22600 71c  the 14700k was 32000 87c   still below throttling  which is ok according to intel   when gaming i only see maybe five frames per second faster at 2k res  this is a good chip  don’t get me wrong  with as many cores as this has  and the speed it should last for a long time  it far exceeds the needs of any  new or future games 
1454,2023-12-05,4,59100,the United States,14700K,i had to replace my h60 to get this to run a full benchmark without hitting thermal limit of 100c with no oc  that is under full core usage during 30s intervals   now that i replaced the cooler with an artic cooler with some kryonaut paste i have it running 5 6 all core with dual core at 5 7 and it maxes out at 87 on furmark
1455,2024-03-26,5,59100,the United States,14700K,super easy to install  just update your motherboard bios to support 14 gen
1456,2024-03-26,5,59100,the United States,14700K,wow  what a beast  intel i7 14700k  it can handle any tasks in pc as game and everyday use  no issues with it  thanks for fast shipping 
1457,2024-02-19,5,59100,the United States,14700K,i never had a cpu on my hands before so i was really stressed out about it 😅  but i was able to mount it and it was the easiest part of my pc built  i don t have any idea about its perfomance yet and for now i just can say that in bios mode it keeps under 95°f with the aio cooler  i will update eventualy when i finish the os instalation
1458,2024-01-07,4,59100,the United States,14700K,undervolt for best performance  don’t get me wrong  it’s a very powerful processor  however there’s typically a lot of heat associated  without undervolting  hitting its 100 degree celsius cap is easier than it probably should be 
1459,2024-03-22,5,59100,Mexico,14700K,the processor arrived well packed and with its conditions and excellent functionality  meets everything it has no stock dissipator  but it is necessary that for this type of processors a more efficient heat dissipator is necessary than those that come in other processors
1460,2023-12-04,4,59100,the United States,14700K,this is a power hungry beast of a processor  under load goes to 280 watt easy   had to set the power limits using intel xtu   but idles at 30n 35 c while browsing and general use    jumped from a i7 9700 k to this    can see huge difference in gaming else its ok   
1461,2024-02-06,5,59100,the United States,14700K,they say the intel 14th gen chips run hot  if thats true then the amd ryzen 7 3700x s run as hot as the sun because this chip is cooler than the amd chips   it does draw a lot of power  but it has like 20 cores  totally worth it 
1462,2024-02-27,3,59100,the United States,14700K,i had tons of issues with this cpu  i returned it and purchased elsewhere due to amazon not having a replacement option or any available at the time for prime shipping  the one that i have now works great  so it s a good product if you get one that works   my second gripe with this cpu is that it s basically just a refresh of 13th gen without the luxury of working out of the box with z790 mobos  you will need to flash the bios of your mobo 
1463,2023-11-14,5,59100,the United States,14700K,built a new system with the 14700k for photo video editing and some gaming  decided to go with the 14th gen i7 instead of the 13th gen since it s the only series that had a noticeable improvement  4 more e cores and threads   very fast for video editing and overkill for most gaming  absolutely love it  i keep it cool with a 360mm aio and a contact plate for even lower temperatures   avg temps   100  load   low 70 s  gaming   mid to high 40 s  low 50 s for more demading titles   idle   browsing   mid 20 s
1464,2024-01-24,5,59100,the United States,14700K,i bought it to do computations on all cores  the best value for money i could find  requires custom loop  delliding if you want to run high boost on all cores for long periods of time  the chip is hot  i will probably drop boost clocks and undervolt to stay cool  using acrtic freezer ii 360 
1465,2024-02-17,5,59100,Germany,14700K,it makes a good pair with the rtx 4070 ti super  but you need a suitable cooler  with be quiet dark rock 4 pro i manage to keep it at 60 maximum 70 degrees in games 
1466,2024-03-20,5,59100,the United States,14700K,it s been great so far  clocking right and no overheating  currently paired with a phanteks 360mm aio 
1467,2024-03-30,5,59100,the United States,14700K,powerful processor for my configuration 
1468,2024-01-27,5,59100,the United States,14700K,play video i decided against the i9 because of cost difference  for my normal usage i use less than 2  of this cpu  but i m really happy with the speed and performance 
1469,2024-02-08,5,59100,the United States,14700K,i upgraded from an 11900k to this  huge gains  pair it with decent hardware and you got a 1440p champ 
1470,2024-01-25,5,59100,the United States,14700K,just undervolt to control the temperature my work just fine with  0 080 mv
1471,2024-02-20,5,59100,the United States,14700K,good 
1472,2024-01-17,5,59100,the United States,14700K,intel is the best of the best
1473,2024-04-03,1,59100,the United States,14700K,overall intel is great for a work station  however the 14 series is stupid as hell    it offers no benefit in 99 9  of situations over 13 series    i upgraded from a 12700k  and saw only minor improvements  and at the expense of power cost  my desktop now idles at 150 250 watts    before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that  in most cases a lot of people wont care  however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like ca  where electricity is  0 44 per kwh  that means just idling is costing me 0 11 per hour  that s  1000 a year just in idling    plus all the electricity my house uses  i m only here temporarily  military  and will be moving as soon as retire  but its something to note   on top of that  its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen  and they blocked apo for the 13th and 12th gen and aren t working on getting it working across the board  only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about      if it was a bit cheaper to go amd  i would have went to a 7800x3d  but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch  due to having to buy new ram  still on ddr4  3600mhz cl14  and motherboard     there s also the constant issue of certain games programs just refusing to run in multithread multicore  or using the e cores inappropriately  intel really needs to sort out this trash   
1474,2024-05-03,1,59100,the United States,14700K,i have written a couple of dozen reviews on amazon and this is only my second negative review  i placed an order for a brand new intel 14700k cpu from amazon and it arrived as an open box  the factory seal had been cut and the processor was jammed into the packaging at an odd angle  i installed it in my system and it would not boot   did not even get past the post testing  i uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective   i give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box  i paid full price for a new cpu  and did not work in my system  it was defective on arrival    it s a month later and i still have not received a refund  i purchased an identical cpu from another source and that cpu booted up with no issues  it is running the pc i am typing this review on  so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that amazon shipped to me 
1475,2024-01-06,5,59100,the United States,14700K,great cpu for gaming  no regrets
1476,2024-01-21,5,59100,the United States,14700K,just great
1477,2024-06-02,1,59100,the United States,14700K,system booted fine with 2 ram sticks installed and it appeared that everything was fine at first but after some time issues started to show up  unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed  at first i thought it was the motherboard or ram  but testing of different ram ruled that out  bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue  putting in a known good cpu allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system ram and that all passed which indicates a issue with the cpu  now i m waiting for intel rma process to have them test the cpu again and hopefully replace it  when i did not have issues  it was a fast cpu  very impressed with that  just wish this showed up sooner
