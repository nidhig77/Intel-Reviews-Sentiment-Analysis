        "review_text": "I bought this i5 11400f in 2023 and still it does its job with no sweat. Well my purpose is editing in premier pro and gaming @1080p resolution. Paired with rtx 3060, its a beast at 1080p. Played competitive games and high graphics intense games like forza horizon 5 etc etc... Does its job fine. A common statement is intel processor's heat better than amd processors, well it is true. It heats very well, stock cooler not enough, my pc even shut downed 3 times when playing high end games used with stock cooler. A decent air cooler is enough to calm down this one, it is not unlocked in fact, so no explanation needed i guess. If u are gonna build a new pc build in 2024 or onwards , please consider 12th gen atleast because u can have great future upgradability chance. When said all these, i took this over 12400f because i felt this enough for my needs and it didn't disappointed me. When considering it is just an i5 i got flabbergasted by its performance fr. Many people say 11th gen is bad but i felt it as worthy for the money i spent and im not gonna do upgrades in future so... Yeah overall it is a good product and im happy with it\ud83d\udc4d. Once again, don't even consider any of 11th gen processors if u are gonna pc build in 2024 and future because 13th gen and 12 th gen is way more future proof that this 11th gen. So yeah that's it.",
