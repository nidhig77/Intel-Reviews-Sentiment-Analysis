Idles in my rig at between 55\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 with air cooling but doesn't go beyond 82\u00b0 when stress tested. I've read where some people were concerned about it idling at 70\u00b0 but it's rated to withstand 120\u00b0. So, a little warm, but high performing. Definitely worth the sale price of $287 (especially if you're used to spending around $350 for a new CPU.)",

I didn\u2019t like the presentation as my box had the original Intel label with serial number covered by an Amazon label and not being able to see the batch and serial number was annoying.

It's cheaper than the 5800X, performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to Overclock. Rocket Lake (11th gen) supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores. It also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake++++ (1.45V load voltage supposedly safe according to Reddit AMA) although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved IPC. This actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests. Gaming load is not bad at all I was seeing around 100w on Horizon Zero Dawn.\nUnless you want the highest overclocks, the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance. Coming from the i9-10900k, the gaming FPS is pretty similar at UW 1440p, but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking - as in you get watch dog BSOD errors or you don\u2019t - not the WHEA stuff. The RAM gear stuff is a little overblown, the performance penalty of running 1:2 is not as bad as what you see on Ryzen. You can run very high speed ram 4800+ and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips. I'm an enthusiast and I've had Ryzen and Intel systems and I just enjoy tuning Intel CPUs. Glad to be one of the first to review this. This came in as same day delivery! Happy overclocking everyone.",

The similar AMD 8 core is a bit more expensive but has cheaper motherboards and draws far less power which means a smaller power bill, a smaller power supply and cheaper cooling solutions.\n\nSo, yes this processor is strong.

It is a bit lower than the 12th gen counterpart, and continually getting a bit cheaper all the time, but it is still close enough in price that if you CAN go with a 12th gen intel build, I would have just gone that route (I was pretty much limited with my choice of mobo, so i could only go as high as 11th gen intel and gen3 m.2).\n\nBut it has been amazing so far in terms of performance under load, and I see this build carrying me for 4-5 years!

Any way I am running it with an RX 560 4GB right now on my UHD 52\" TV on low settings unless video cards come back down to reasonable prices again & it works fine for the games I play. If you do not game or need use of powerful graphics its great for surfing the web, watching videos & streams. Otherwise I advise you find or have a video card if you want to game or what ever.\n\nGreat CPU!\n\nUpdate 04/09/2024 - Currently I run this CPU with 96GB DDR4 3200, RTX 3060 Ti 8GB, 500GB WDBlack M2 as OS Drive, 4TB M2 for Games, 1KW PSU, I have 2x 240CFM fans on it, and 3 others to cool my system none of which I ever need to run about 25% air flow.",

I am going to check through everything today, maybe something changed in my bios for some reason.

I own the 12900K for over 6 months and decided to go back to the 11gen. Even though Alder lake is more powerful, since it is very new, it has way too many drawback and the high latency of rams is the main reason why I decided to sell it.

The integrated graphics are decent enough for light gaming on games such as League of Legends and provides a nice backup graphics in the event that the GPU fails. I would definitely appreciate more cores on it, but all in all, its a pretty good upgrade from my previous 7th gen Intel PC.",
