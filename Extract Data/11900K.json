Couldn't figure it out at first and found myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc. After research I was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps. What ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the Performance Menu.\n\nIn those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99% my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80-85. This tuning comes without a noticeable hit on FPS except while playing \"Squad\" (a single core use cpu intensive game). With that game I do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99%. This is not that big of a deal as I can easily tick it up to 100% for Squad and just put up with the 75-80 temps!\n\nHappy that I can at least play most of my games at a good temp while gaining good performance by this upgrade!",

The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200. By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs. This i9-11900K will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100%, and that's right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today.",

I purchased (1) of the most graphic intensive AAA game titles and a few CPU intensive military strategy simulation games known for their heavy demand for CPU physics computations. My Core i9-11900K which I purchased in 2022 performed admirably well on all accounts. Absolutely no complaints. Some reports say that the i9-11900K runs hot and sometimes above the 100\u00b0C mark? But that was not really the case with me or the many others when they installed a high quality 360mm or above sized AIO water cooler. My very demanding combat simulation (Command: Modern Operations) never presented a heating issue with the i9-11900K and with my over 80-hours of heavy duty play. For good measure my Cosmos C700M EATX case also includes a total of (7) additional independent Noctua cooling fans, which of course benefits the cooling within the massive interior of the enclosure. Overall I am extremely satisfied with INTEL in general and recommend the i9-11900K and or its newer siblings now as a very good buy!",

I wanted PCIe 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4.0 and I was considering a 5900X but I found the AMD X570 motherboard feature sets to be disappointing even at the high end. Anyway, I usually buy Intel Processors although I've occasionally bought AMD in the past. I have a very good Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360 CPU Liquid Cooler which keeps the temperatures reasonably cool. I also bought an ASUS Z590 MAXIMUS XIII HERO motherboard, everything is faster with this CPU and motherboard, from storage to graphics.",

So far, I am not happy but still can convince myself that I am just not lucky even I feel ridiculous about why such expensive items have so many defective products. I tried to use the warranty to get a new one or fix it, but Intel's customer service is ridiculous slow. After we tell them the issue, it has been a month and they are still verifying our information. it took them 4 days to reply us and told us what info they need. We sent them the information immediately. It took another 4 days to tell us that one of the information is wrong. We gave them the correct information immediately. This time, it took 10 days to tell us that purchase information is good, but they need the account holder to authorize the warranty (why do not you tell us this at beginning?). After this, it has been several days and we still wait for the reply now. I do not understand why it takes so many days to just verify the customer information. Should not this be done in 1 days or even 1 hour? I understand it takes time to reply and communicate cross teams, but it still takes too long time.
