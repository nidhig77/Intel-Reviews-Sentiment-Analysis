        "review_text": "No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",

        "review_text": "I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.\n\nSome background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought \"Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile.\" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem \"Premium\" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...\n\nIf you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.\n\nTL:DR\nUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.\nUpgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.\nParts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)\n\nPros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!\n\nCons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).\n\nI hope this review helps people!",

I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that. AMD seems to be all the hype but I see why Intel won't be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip.",

Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.\n\nI hope you find this review helpful.",

The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",

        "review_text": "The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.\n\nIf you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:\n1. i9-13900k\n2. i7-13700k\n3. i9-12900k\n4. i5-13600k\n5. i7-12700k\n\nThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)",

As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.\n\nSome things to consider before purchasing:\n1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.\n2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.\n3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.\n\nGood luck!",

It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months. 3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be, from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect. The days of getting another 800Mhz - 1 Ghz+ over stock clocks out of a CPU are gone it seems.",
