But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80\u00b0C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80\u00b0C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80\u00b0c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.\n\nBut anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors.",

Us\u00e9 una tarjeta ASUS Z690-F la cual NO reconoc\u00eda las memorias (Us\u00e9 64GB Corsair a 5200 MHZ), la m\u00e1quina simplemente no booteaba y quedaba encendida la luz naranja de la motherboard indicando problemas en DRAM, despu\u00e9s de leer mucho encontr\u00e9 que era necesario actualizar el BIOS desde la conexi\u00f3n trasera FLASHBACK, una vez hecho la operaci\u00f3n ha sido correcta y no he tenido mayores problemas. Instal\u00e9 un radiador de 120mm cooler master lite para controlar al procesador ya que por incre\u00edble que suene el KRAKEN x73 de 360mm no fue capaz de mantener a raya las temperaturas. El Cooler Master de 120mm mantiene al procesador sin carga o carga m\u00ednima entre los 32 y 40 grados y con carga m\u00e1xima y tests pega a los 80 grados, lo cual simplemente es genial teniendo en cuenta que la temperatura m\u00e1xima del Procesador es de 125 grados, al radiador le coloqu\u00e9 2 Ventiladores Noctua a 3000 revoluciones en configuraci\u00f3n push / pull.

It works really good, very very fast, and can ***multi task heavy software like they're nothing*** and with a push pull AIO it averages around 28*C and when I'm gaming it stays around 50-40*C with graphics maxed out.

We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W. And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.\n\nOne system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot. We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A. We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly. So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.\n\nOrdered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up. We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again. This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.\n\nSo 2 out of 10 desktops are defective This is a huge surprise. These systems had no GPU, only motherboard, 64GB of DDR5, and an SSD. Has anyone else seen this?",

Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard. I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update. After that it boots this CPU just fine.\nBefore this I was a die-hard AMD supporter. I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache. But, it just doesn't compete with this i9. I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores. Even with less cache. The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works. It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD. I use a water cooler, but it's not required. Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.\nI wish the AMD was better, I like the company more. But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available. If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you. It will NOT disappoint.\n\nA word on the X790 chipset. You would think they will have better performance because they are newer. They don't. They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update. They have one more USB port. But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more. So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great.",

I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don\u2019t want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent.

Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not. Video editing can benefit from the extra cores. Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked). Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution. Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility. I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler. With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor. While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C. Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C. Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.
