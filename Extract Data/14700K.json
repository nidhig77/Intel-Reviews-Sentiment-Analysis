One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).\n\nI also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.\n\nThis CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.\n\nIf you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.",

        "review_text": "I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.\n\nCooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.\n\nSo what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.\n\nI mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.",

Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.\n\nThere's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast.

User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.\n\nThe main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).\n\nMostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.\n\nOn top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...\n\nIf it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...\n\nThere's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash...",

I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing. I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.\n\nI give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.

Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed. At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM. But testing of different RAM ruled that out. Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue. Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU. Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it. When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner.",
