Hier sind meine Eindr\u00fccke nach intensiver Nutzung:\n\nLeistung:\nMit seinen 24 Kernen und einer beeindruckenden Taktrate liefert der i9-14900KF eine unglaubliche Leistung. Egal ob beim Gaming, bei der Videobearbeitung oder beim Multitasking \u2013 dieser Prozessor meistert alles m\u00fchelos. In Spielen wie Cyberpunk 2077 und Red Dead Redemption 2 laufen die Grafiken butterweich, selbst bei h\u00f6chsten Einstellungen. Die Ladezeiten sind minimal und das Gameplay ist absolut fl\u00fcssig.\n\nMultitasking:\nIch arbeite oft mit mehreren anspruchsvollen Anwendungen gleichzeitig \u2013 von Adobe Premiere Pro \u00fcber Photoshop bis hin zu Blender. Der i9-14900KF bew\u00e4ltigt diese Aufgaben ohne ins Schwitzen zu geraten. Selbst wenn ich ein Video rendere und gleichzeitig in einem anderen Fenster an einem gro\u00dfen Bildbearbeitungsprojekt arbeite, bleibt das System reaktionsschnell und stabil.\n\nK\u00fchlung:\nApropos K\u00fchlung \u2013 der i9-14900KF kann unter Last ziemlich warm werden. Ich habe mich f\u00fcr eine hochwertige Wasserk\u00fchlung von NZXT entschieden (Kraken 360 Elite), um die Temperaturen im Griff zu behalten. Mit dieser AIO bleibt der Prozessor auch bei intensiven Gaming-Sessions oder langen Renderzeiten k\u00fchl und leise.\n\nPreis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis:\nDer Preis des i9-14900KF ist sicherlich nicht niedrig, aber angesichts der gebotenen Leistung halte ich ihn f\u00fcr gerechtfertigt. F\u00fcr Enthusiasten und Profis, die maximale Performance ben\u00f6tigen, ist dieser Prozessor eine lohnende Investition.\n\nFazit:\nDer Intel Core i9-14900KF ist ein absolutes Monster in Sachen Leistung. Ob beim Gaming, bei kreativen Arbeiten oder beim Multitasking \u2013 dieser Prozessor liefert konstant beeindruckende Ergebnisse. Die M\u00f6glichkeit zur \u00dcbertaktung bietet zus\u00e4tzlichen Spielraum f\u00fcr Performance-Enthusiasten. Auch wenn er etwas teurer ist und eine gute K\u00fchlung erfordert, bin ich rundum zufrieden mit meiner Wahl und kann den i9-14900KF jedem empfehlen, der das Beste aus seinem System herausholen m\u00f6chte.",

        "review_text": "So far so good. This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset. I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas. I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.\n\nIn gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games\n\n**Update**\n\nI have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling! As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset. If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes. So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.\n\nIf you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled. But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.\n\nThe only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be. Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance. My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.\n\nCore wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",

        "review_text": "So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.!\nAlso, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly.\nApplications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build.\nThe one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims.\nWith this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive.\nIt is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",

        "review_text": "I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal. I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card. I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage. Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate. Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again. This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.\n\nI'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.\n\nI really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.\n\nI honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessor\n\nI had to purchase 2 rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.\n\nI hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.",

        "review_text": "This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube \"videos\" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers\u2014Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.\n\nFor those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans\u2014\n\nAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.\n\nWhen selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.\n\nThe 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse\u2014achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...\n\nDid I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40\u00b0C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50\u00b0C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods\u2014increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.\n\nAs of this date\u20144-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.\n\nThe X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...\n\nWe'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the \"normie YouTuber AMD cults.\"\n\nIndeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the \"benefits\" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees. Just having fun, do what you love!\n\nI don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!\n\nNote:\nSettings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours. I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage.... Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth.",

        "review_text": "A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.\n\nI honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)\n\nIf you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80\u2070 occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)",

        "review_text": "I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use. After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result. I finally disabled overclocking \"AI overclocking\", which was running as high as 1.6v. I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE. this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully. It basically throttles the chip.\n\nI can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out. Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all \"tests\" showed it was fine. I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive. It does run HOT even with water cooling. IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5. Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.\n\nHere's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use. Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing. HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300. So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.\n\nSystem was using \"AI overclocking\" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core. Disabled in BIOS now.\nSpecs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080ti\n\nSo the \"K\" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me. That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip.",

The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.\n\nyes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.\n\nhere is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores\n\n1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black\n2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)\n3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)\n4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)\n5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)\n6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)\n7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.\n\nthen i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select \"CPU cooler tuning\" select \"tower air cooling\" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!\n\nso using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was 2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.\n\ni personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.\n\npersonal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(",

That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.\nWhen it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.\nOverall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed.",

        "review_text": "Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an \"upgrade\" from a i9-13900KF to i9-14900K . It's OK but I can't rave over it. It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.\n\nThe i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K. For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen. Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K. Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful. I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.\n\nI did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures. Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better. Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C). I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing. A second one became slightly flaky.\n\nI thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display. But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me. If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays. IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.\n\nThe original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night. On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package. It took literally 6 months to get a refund. That was rather irksome.",

To think that I can also squeeze out more by overclocking is just insane. Every application I've ran is so snappy and responsive. Being an impatient human, this thing makes me happier every time I turn it on. Power and Speed are right where I like it. This chip is just so damn sweet!",

        "review_text": "I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother. It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience.",
