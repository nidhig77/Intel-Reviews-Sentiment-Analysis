Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in Germany on 11 June 2024,"Nachdem ich meinen PC mit dem Intel Core i9-14900KF aufgerüstet habe, kann ich sagen, dass dieser Prozessor ein echtes Kraftpaket ist. Hier sind meine Eindrücke nach intensiver Nutzung:

Leistung:
Mit seinen 24 Kernen und einer beeindruckenden Taktrate liefert der i9-14900KF eine unglaubliche Leistung. Egal ob beim Gaming, bei der Videobearbeitung oder beim Multitasking – dieser Prozessor meistert alles mühelos. In Spielen wie Cyberpunk 2077 und Red Dead Redemption 2 laufen die Grafiken butterweich, selbst bei höchsten Einstellungen. Die Ladezeiten sind minimal und das Gameplay ist absolut flüssig.

Multitasking:
Ich arbeite oft mit mehreren anspruchsvollen Anwendungen gleichzeitig – von Adobe Premiere Pro über Photoshop bis hin zu Blender. Der i9-14900KF bewältigt diese Aufgaben ohne ins Schwitzen zu geraten. Selbst wenn ich ein Video rendere und gleichzeitig in einem anderen Fenster an einem großen Bildbearbeitungsprojekt arbeite, bleibt das System reaktionsschnell und stabil.

Kühlung:
Apropos Kühlung – der i9-14900KF kann unter Last ziemlich warm werden. Ich habe mich für eine hochwertige Wasserkühlung von NZXT entschieden (Kraken 360 Elite), um die Temperaturen im Griff zu behalten. Mit dieser AIO bleibt der Prozessor auch bei intensiven Gaming-Sessions oder langen Renderzeiten kühl und leise.

Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis:
Der Preis des i9-14900KF ist sicherlich nicht niedrig, aber angesichts der gebotenen Leistung halte ich ihn für gerechtfertigt. Für Enthusiasten und Profis, die maximale Performance benötigen, ist dieser Prozessor eine lohnende Investition.

Fazit:
Der Intel Core i9-14900KF ist ein absolutes Monster in Sachen Leistung. Ob beim Gaming, bei kreativen Arbeiten oder beim Multitasking – dieser Prozessor liefert konstant beeindruckende Ergebnisse. Die Möglichkeit zur Übertaktung bietet zusätzlichen Spielraum für Performance-Enthusiasten. Auch wenn er etwas teurer ist und eine gute Kühlung erfordert, bin ich rundum zufrieden mit meiner Wahl und kann den i9-14900KF jedem empfehlen, der das Beste aus seinem System herausholen möchte.",Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i9-14900KF,"₹82,350"

This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset. I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas. I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.

In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games

**Update**

I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling! As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset. If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes. So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.

If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled. But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.

The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be. Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance. My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.

Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i9-14900KF,"₹82,350"

It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.!
Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly.
Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build.
The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims.
With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive.
It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i9-14900K,"₹82,350"

I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card. I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage. Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate. Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again. This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.

I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.

However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.

For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—

Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.

When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.

The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...

Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.

As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.

The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...

We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""

Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees. Just having fun, do what you love!

I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!

I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.

I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)

If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80⁰ occasionally, for a very brief moment.

They all had serious stability problems when in use. After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result. I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v. I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE. this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully. It basically throttles the chip.

I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out. Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine. I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive. It does run HOT even with water cooling. IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5. Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.

Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use. Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing. HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300. So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.

System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core. Disabled in BIOS now.

i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.

ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.

yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.

here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores

1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black
2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)
3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)
4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)
5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)
6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)
7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.

then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!

so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was 2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.

i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.

personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(",Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i9-14900K,"₹82,350"

It's OK but I can't rave over it. It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.

The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K. For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen. Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K. Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful. I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.

I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures. Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better. Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C). I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing. A second one became slightly flaky.

I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display. But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me. If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays. IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.

He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.

The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.

While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.

Once again, don't even consider any of 11th gen processors if u are gonna pc build in 2024 and future because 13th gen and 12 th gen is way more future proof that this 11th gen.

I think at this price (I got it at pre-launch sale of $399) it's a good product. It's cheaper than the 5800X, performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to Overclock. Rocket Lake (11th gen) supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores. It also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake++++ (1.45V load voltage supposedly safe according to Reddit AMA) although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved IPC. This actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests. Gaming load is not bad at all I was seeing around 100w on Horizon Zero Dawn.
Unless you want the highest overclocks, the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance. Coming from the i9-10900k, the gaming FPS is pretty similar at UW 1440p, but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking - as in you get watch dog BSOD errors or you don’t - not the WHEA stuff. The RAM gear stuff is a little overblown, the performance penalty of running 1:2 is not as bad as what you see on Ryzen. You can run very high speed ram 4800+ and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips. I'm an enthusiast and I've had Ryzen and Intel systems and I just enjoy tuning Intel CPUs.

But if money is a consideration. Or your power bill. Or how much you need to spend on cooling. Or what AMD offers. Well, you can do better. The similar AMD 8 core is a bit more expensive but has cheaper motherboards and draws far less power which means a smaller power bill, a smaller power supply and cheaper cooling solutions.

HOWEVER< it barely gets much hotter under full load so perhaps I have tuned fairly well...

Value is just OK. It is a bit lower than the 12th gen counterpart, and continually getting a bit cheaper all the time, but it is still close enough in price that if you CAN go with a 12th gen intel build, I would have just gone that route (I was pretty much limited with my choice of mobo, so i could only go as high as 11th gen intel and gen3 m.2).

Couldn't figure it out at first and found myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc. After research I was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps. What ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the Performance Menu.

In those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99% my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80-85. This tuning comes without a noticeable hit on FPS except while playing ""Squad"" (a single core use cpu intensive game). With that game I do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99%. This is not that big of a deal as I can easily tick it up to 100% for Squad and just put up with the 75-80 temps!

Step 1: get an 11th gen processor (this i9 if its in your budget)
Step 2: get a motherboard with gen 4 pcie slots (z590-e was my go to)

The item came even sooner than expected.
The bad news is that I installed it in my previously flawless running machine. The reason I upgraded from my current i910900k is that I wanted to enable the NVME.2 4.0 on my SSD. I already had the drive and a Z590 motherboard so why not right? I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error. (This is caused by CPU cores failing to communicate with each other.)
I called Intel tech support who was less than help full. I updated all drivers and still didn't work.
I did notice my CPU temp was running over 100c. Odd because I have the best nactura CPU cooler they sell. I decided to upgrade to a liquid CPU cooler and that brought my CPU temp down to around 85c.
That still didn't fix the time out errors. I put my old CPU back and all is happy. I ended up sending the i9 11900k back but at least my i9 10900k is nice and cool even at 45% overclock. LOL",Style Name: CPU Only,"₹80,000"

I got into mine for under $410.00 with an ITX motherboard. This suddenly changes the 11900K to being an excellent value.

l'Intel® i3 12100F è un processore di 12° generazione,dotato di 4 core
ad alte prestazioni di ultima generazione e 8 thread,monta su schede
madri con attacco LGA1700,supporta le Ram DDR4 e DDR5,supporta le
connessioni PCI-E 5.0 e 4.0,ha un clock di sistema da un minimo
di 3.3GHz e fino a 4.3GHz,ha un consumo minimo di 60W e 89W di
picco,non è previsto l'overclock per alzare ulteriormente la
frequenza operativa,ma supporta l'overclock delle RAM sia in
DDR4 che in DDR5,questa funzione gli permette di guadagnare
in prestazioni (soprattutto nel gaming) quasi paragonabili
all'overclock del processore se fosse sbloccato.

Questa è in sintesi la sinossi di questo processore,
il web è pieno di recensioni molto più tecniche che
spiegano perchè l'Intel i3 1200F è al momento,
la migliore ed unica CPU da gaming nella
fascia dei 110/130 euro.

Le prestazioni sono inequivocabilmente eccellenti per chi
desidera giocare in full-hd mantenendo un budget basso.

Inoltre in molti videogames se la gioca alla pari con
processori dal costo quasi doppio e con qualche Core in più.

Si difende molto bene anche nei benchmark a singolo core,
tuttavia nei carichi con molti core perde qualcosa ovviamente.

La doppia compatibilità sia con DDR4 che con DDR5 e con
il PCI-E 4.0 e 5.0 ci permette di poter scegliere anche
una scheda madre dal prezzo adeguato al nostro budget,
come ad esempio una H610 compatibile con l'i3 12000F
ma che supporta le sole DDR4 e il PCI-E 4.0.

Quindi scheda madre economica e che monta RAM DDR4 facilmente
reperibili a prezzi più umani delle DDR5 giusto per capirci,inoltre l'i3
12000F è prestante e competitivo anche con le DDR4 e vari test
sul web lo dimostrano.

📦 ⭐Confezione⭐ :
La scatola è nel classico colore Intel,con sigillo da rimuovere,
a riprova di un prodotto nuovo,all'interno troviamo il processore
nella sua vaschetta in plastica,un ottimo dissipatore intel,adeguato
alla CPU in oggetto con già il cerotto dissipante applicato alla sua base,
un sintetico manuale con attaccato nella pagina principale l'adesivo staccabile
di Intel® Core i3 da apporre,se si vuole,sul fronte del case.

🚚 ⭐Spedizione⭐ :
A cura di Amazon,quindi rapida,sicura e
conforme agli standard dell'azienda.

📉📈 ⭐Considerazioni finali⭐ :
Un ottimo processore dalle ottime performance se si vuole tenere la spesa in
un certo range ma che si difende benissimo sia nel gaming che nei lavori di
tutti i giorni.

il mio voto personale relazionato al rapporto Prestazioni/prezzo
è di ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ stelle.

La mia scala di voto è così definita:
⭐️ stella prodotto da evitare
⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto insufficiente,
⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto sufficiente,
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto buono,
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ stelle prodotto ottimo.

Spero che questa mia recensione ti abbia aiutato a capire

Depuis 20 ans, je n'avais acheté que du AMD, mais à le lecture de nombreux tests qui avaient mis en avant les qualités du 12100F, j'avais donc décidé de franchir le pas.
Au départ, je voulais un processeur à la fois suffisamment puissant dans les jeux, et qui ne chauffe pas (et donc qui ne consomme pas). Déjà parce qu'il était destiné à être placé dans un HTPC, ayant par essence un airflow un peu compliqué, et ensuite car je souhaitais optimiser le rapport performances/énergie.
Je pense que c'est mission accomplie. En lecture de films, ou pendant l'écoute de musique, le processeur Intel et la carte graphique (GTX 1660 TI) ne dépassent pas chacun les 35°c, et grimpent respectivement à 47°c et 62°c lors des sessions de jeux.
Je précise que le 12100F est refroidi par un ventirad Low Profile Noctua NHL-12S, appuyé par un ventilateur Arctic P12, et est fixé au socket par un cadre d'ajustement, sensé éviter les déformations de la surface du processeur, de marque Thermalright.
En terme de puissance, ce processeur peut-être associé à n'importe quelle carte graphique sans limiter le potentiel de cette dernière, sauf peut-être celles au-dessus des très puissantes AMD RX 6900 XT et des RTX 3080 TI.
En applicatif en revanche, l'Intel pêchera un peu sans pour autant être ridicule. Sachez qu'elle a autant de répondant qu'un haut de gamme d'il y a 4 ans.
Pour résumer, au regard du prix, le 12100F est ce qu'il se fait de mieux pour un ordinateur destiné à un usage polyvalent et économique.",,"₹14,500"

Se ovviamente si cerca un prodotto entrylevel. Dalle recensioni ha prestazioni da fascia superiore di qualche anno fa, la CPU ha 4 core con HT quindi gestisce 8Th.
L'ho acquistata per un secondo PC in un case micro-ATX con una sola 92mm posteriore in estrazione. Come prestazioni e reattività la CPU è veramente niente male navigazione, riproduzione. Ho fatto qualche bench tipo CPUZ e va un pò di più del mio R5 1600 in multi (6c/12t) e molto di più in ST.

In buona sostanza se cercate una CPU per uso navigazione, riproduzione, produttività leggera, gaming (magari retrogaming su giochi DX11) è il prodotto giusto. Se fate gaming su giochi moderni (DX12) e con obiettivo di refresh sostenuti (anche minimi) allora meglio un 12400 o superiore (parlando di Intel).

Ho fatto dei test con Intelburntest e la CPU resta a 4,089GHz su tutti i core con T di 75° in inverno e 82° a Luglio. Premetto che uso il dissi stock ho solo cambiato la pasta termica (arctic MX4). La ventola tende a girare un po' veloce per tenere la T sotto controllo, comunque non è rumorosissima anzi. Diciamo che secondo me il dissi è un pò al limite però tiene la CPU a bada.

The price is well below other retail shops in Singapore including Sim Lim square. Although it is shipped from overseas, it is genuine and the packaging arrived sealed and undamaged. The shipping time also took less than a week.

The only problem was that motherboards with LGA 1700 sockets (that supports 12gen Intel processors) are currently much more expensive than LGA 1200 or AMD counterparts, so I had to settle with a non ideal mATX motherboard to stay within my budget.",Style Name: Cache,"₹28,500"

It feels incredibly snappy now. With GPUs now costing your firstborn child, it's nice that this upgrade boosted an aging gtx970 FPS by 5-15%. (@2560x1080) Gaming is also much smoother as low-FPS spikes are effectively non-existent now.

The included heatsink and fan is actually not as terrible as I was anticipating. It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent. It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming. I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine. I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead.

The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup. Anyone who doesn't need that should seek out the ""12400F"" model as it's the exact same chip with no internal GPU, and it should be $15-$25 cheaper.

I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming.

One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)

The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s.

Come è giusto che sia, anziché comprare portatilini e preassemblati, un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo, e oltre a questo, condivide la sua esperienza nell'antica arte del PC Building anche con amici e parenti. Mio fratello aveva necessità di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?

Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perché trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualità. Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque è identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino più alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.

Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie più costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo più 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.
Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni più complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.

L'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.

PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURE
Come dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni più ""professionali"". L'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, è eccellente.
Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttività utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell'hardware sia all'altezza.
Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po' serie può sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.
In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarà usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.

Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perché non mi è arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece è decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che è accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale è abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perché per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente è necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.

VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?
La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilità della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che è una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perché ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? Perché con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lì a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che può sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che può sfruttare l'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.

In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata è la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 è la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissà cosa. La potenza di questa è simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giù di lì, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.

Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due è la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore è scarso ma per una CPU come questa è sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.

PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?
Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore è il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perché.
Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.
Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco più alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente più potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze più alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di più o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata è di poco più potente, ma si tratta sempre di un'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100€ in più. Evitatelo. Io l'ho comprato solo perché mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anziché il 12400. Altrimenti non l'avrei mai comprato.

Il 12600 invece è su un altro campo da gioco, ed è a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze più alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150€ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget più alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU più potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.

Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.

CONCLUSIONE
Che dire, il 12400 è una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l'altro. È eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).

Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto.",Pattern Name: Processor,"₹29,999"

Für den Preis gibt es in Sachen gaming nichts zu meckern ich denke die CPU richtet sich durch die fehlende igpu auch an solche.

1 keine igpu ohne eine eigene Grafikkarte kein Bild
2 Boxed Kühler kann man sofort entsorgen (Trotz angegebener 65watt) mit Boxed Kühler über 80 Grad

Dann zu den Pluspunkten

- Leistung für Grade einmal 119€ erhält man ein CPU mit dem man eigentliche jegliches Spiel über der 60 FPS Marke daddeln kann.

-Temparaturen auch wen der Boxed Kühler nicht zu gebrauchen ist läst sich die CPU auch unter Volllast mit einem normalen Luft Kühler (20€) bei 50 bis 52 Grad halten was absolut top ist .

Es gibt einfach für diesen Preis nichts zu meckern und jeder 1080p Spieler bis 144Hertz Sollte seine Freude mit der CPU haben.

Non credo comunque che possa cambiare più di tanto in gaming, visti parecchi video comparativi anche con i7 ed i9 della stessa serie e gli fps sono praticamente gli stessi.. il che lascia parecchi quesiti sul senso o meno di spendere 3 volte tanto per ottenere poco o niente in più, sempre restando in ambito gaming, nella produttività sicuramente processori con più threads faranno la differenza.",Pattern Name: Processor,"₹29,999"

My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith.

I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors.
I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them.
I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better. I would recommend the I5 12600k to anyone looking for a reasonably priced new chip that will allow their systems to handle most tasks with ease for the foreseeable future.",,"₹41,100"

I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs.

I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.

The Core i5-12600K is roughly competitive in performance and price with the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X.",,"₹41,100"

Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",Style Name: Processor Only,"₹60,000"

I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.

Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...

If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.

TL:DR
Upgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.
Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.
Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)

Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!

Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).

AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.

If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:
1. i9-13900k
2. i7-13700k
3. i9-12900k
4. i5-13600k
5. i7-12700k

This chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.

In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper.

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United States on 15 February 2022,"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.

Some things to consider before purchasing:
1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.
2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.
3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.

Good luck!",Style Name: Processor Only,"₹60,000"

I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.

Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.

The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.

The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering.

ASUSの簡易水冷(ROG240mm)で運用。ケースが古いので360mmは断念。
定格使用でH.265のエンコード時にCPU温度は80℃後半を維持できます。

Z690マザーなのでオーバークロック。
6コアまでなら倍率54で回ります。温度は90℃に届くかどうか程度。電圧はoffsetで-0.05V。この場合Core temp読みで消費電力は241Wに届きませんでした。
ただ、オールコアをいじり倍率50にしただけで300W近くまで消費するとともにCPU温度は一瞬で100℃へ。即サーマルスロットリングが作動します。

いずれも室温は27℃での検証です。

360mmの簡易水冷にしたとて一瞬で100℃に上がる温度は抑えきれないと思いますのでサーマルスロットリングに当てたくないのであればオーバークロックは難しいのでは？と思いました。
単コアであれば54倍で安定動作しているので満足です。

6700Kからの換装でしたが10分間の動画をH.265にエンコードしたとき、6700Kは約15分、12900Kは約7分で終了。
時代の変化を感じます。

premiere Proでの動画編集(4Kを8ストリーム)でも全コアフルパワーにはなりませんでした。エンコードするときと、ベンチを回すときくらいですかね。

The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again?

Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor.

I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.
After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.
For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.
So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.
Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.
If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling.",Style Name: CPU Core i9-12900K,"₹99,999"

Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",Style Name: CPU Core i9-12900K,"₹99,999"

It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace.

Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.

If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.

My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.

Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.

Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.

So I bought this processor to replace my ryzen 7 2700x that finally decided to die on me. I have had the ryzen since launch.

I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.

With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.

My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender. Or in zbrush, maya, 3ds max, or substance painter.",Style Name: CoreI5-13400F,"₹20,250"

Lo he instalado en una placa Asus Rog strig B660 F Wifi, dos nvme m2, (Kinston y Crucial), memoria Corsair de 6000 mh.

La placa, tras la actualización en frío de la bios aceptó sin problema el processdor de G3, la memora, tras activar la pestaña de la bios, funciona a 6000 mh sin problema.

Como he dicho, lo compré para la edición de vídeo, he estado haciendo una prueba con la gráfica integrada, (todavía no he colocado la dedicada).

Me he llevado una grata sorpresa, pues con esta configuración sin gráfica integrada, he creado un vídeo de 15 minutos, sin trancisiones ni nada, (era una prueba), el vídeo en bruto, tras 3 o 4 minutos, vídeo terminado cuando con mi viejo i7 tardaba de media hora a 45 minutos, estoy hablando de una resolucion de 1920x1080. o sea, puede con ello. Quizá tenga algo que ver también el programa de edición que no es de los punteros que todo el mundo nombra, pero que es fantástico y hace lo mismo. Llevo mucho tiempo usando el programa Magix de edición, si mi antiguo PC podía, este debía poder mucho más, como así ha sido, ya que el programa en sí no requiere tantos recursos.

De momento muy contento. Lo tengo con el disipador que todo el mundo odia, (el de origen) que viene junto al procesador.

Cuando edite a toda pastilla veré si se calienta o no, de momento no.

Simplemente quiero dar un tiron de oreja a quien corresponda ya que la caja me llegó desprecintada y por criticarlo, Amazón no me ha publicado dos reseñas anteriores al montaje del mismo.

Se me olvidaba, el procesador lo he montado con la placa de sugeción que se vende a parte y asegura el procesador de cuatro tornillos para evitar que se doble.

So far, it's got it's ups and downs. But it seems to be at par with the Ryzen 7 5700g. Though better in lots of ways....like, being to use either DDR 4 or 5. Or PCIe 4 or 5, depending on mother board. While the Ryzen 7 5700g is stuck at PCIe 3.

Anyway, I loved it. But decided to swap with with a i9 14900k.

I donated it to a friend along with a few other parts to upgrade her system from an A10 to this. So far it's been real good to her.

The only odd note about this processor and it's IGPU counterpart is, this one have more cache. While the IGPU version have less cache. Try to weigh in your options when looking at this over the other. I picked this due to a tiny drop in price with the added extra cache. But, it wouldn't be great for my itx rebuild I did later on.

同じエンコード設定で他のPCと比較すると・・・
Core 2 Quad Q8200は5fps (AVX命令がないSSE4時代なのでお察し)
Celeon N4100は5fps (4コアAtom≒Core 2 Quadの法則)
Ryzen 5 3500Uは7fps (Zen+のAVX256は内部的にSSE4相当の128bit処理で激遅)
Ryzen 5 Pro 3400GEは17fps (Zen+なのでお察し。体感Sandy Bridgeと同程度)
Core i7 4770は20fps (Zen+より速いがHaswellなので時代遅れ感否めず)
Ryzne 5 5500Uは25fps (型番詐欺のZen2、6コアだが2.5GHzしか出ない)
Core i5 1135G7は30fps (AVX512対応で4コアの割に速い。2023年現在もワッパ最強説)
Ryzen 7 Pro 5750GEは45fps (Zen3はAVX512非対応で8コアの割に遅い)

SSE/AVXとか知らない人向けに捕捉。
SSE/AVX(いわゆるSIMD命令)はCPUの演算レジスタ(最近のは256～512bit)を変数型(8～64bit)に合わせて細分化し、計算を並列化する技術です。AVX256では8bit変数を32並列で計算しているが、AVX512なら64並列で計算できるということです。最近のCPUの性能はほぼAVX命令の速度で決まります。特に動画のエンコードや生成AIの速度はAVX命令の優劣が如実に表れます。

intelはHaswell Refresh(第4世代)の頃からAVX命令が速くて動画変換に強いのと、アイドル時は700MHz程度まで落ち込む(Ryzenだとせいぜい1.4GHz程度)ので省電力性能も高いのが良いですね。

ただし、電力リミットが全然働かないマザーボードだと冷却に苦労します。TDP65W向けのCPUクーラーではサーマルスロットリングで3.0GHz程度に落ち込みます。それでも上記の性能が出るので大したものです。立派なCPUクーラーを付けたら常時4.0GHz前後で動くのでしょうね。

AtomからXeonまで幅広いCPUを作っているintelが得意とするP-Core(シングル性能特化)とE-Core(効率・マルチ性能重視)の異種混合CPUも2代目。製造プロセス(nm値)ではAMDやARMに遅れがちですが、やはりアーキテクチャ技術や命令セットではまだまだintelが優れているのかなと思います。Tiger Lake(11世代)以下から乗り換えれば性能倍増も夢ではないので、技術の進歩に驚くばかりです。

内蔵GPUは実行ユニット数32個 (Tiger Lakeのi5 1135G7だと80個もある) なのでオマケ程度と割り切るべきでしょう。少しでもゲームをする気があるなら素直にビデオカード増設を。しかしビデオカードがなくてもモニタ出力できるのは便利です。

最近はi5ですら円安で3.5万円もかかるから悩ましい。昔だったら同じ値段でi7が買えていたのに。。。
最近は5000円程度の激安マザボもなくなり、安くて1.5万円はかかる時代なのでCPU+マザボだけで5万円コースに。。。それでもいい買い物をしたと思っています。

【2023/10/29追記】
CPUクーラーを交換してTDP65W縛りをやめた結果...。
定格65WのCPUを電力制限無視して実質OCしているようなものなので仕方ないとは思いますが、GIGABYTE B760M DS3H DDR4にてTDP125W設定で使用していると、CPU電圧が1.4Vを超えたあたりから動作が不安定になります。TDP100W設定のCPU電圧1.3V程度で使うと安定します。やたらCPU電圧を盛りたがるマザボでは使用しない方が良さそうです。",Style Name: CoreI5-13500,"₹20,250"

This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage. Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu. I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu. The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned. I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new. The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that. I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back. My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization. At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%. All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11.

The turboboost behavior is not what I'm used to. I do not recommend this one. The performance overall is better then the older ones ofcourse, but the powerlimits and frequencies are all over the place, and not how it should be on paper. Max turbo power should be 143Watts and all core turbo 4.1GHz . My sample's All core turbo didn't go above 3.9GHz and the power draw didn't went above 80 watts. and that's lower then previous gens.

Die Verpackung ist simpel gehalten, keine irrelevanten Informationen und hat eine ansprechende Wirkung auf mich.

Auf dem Prozessor ist wie immer der Produktname und die Taktfrequenz abgebildet.
Die CPU hat in seinem Preisfeld keine wirkliche Konkurrenz, die ähnliche Leistungen aufweisen. Der Preis ist zudem sehr angemessen. Mir gefällt vor allem die Teilung der Prozessorkerne, die die Aufgaben des Pc's nebenbei gut getrennt erfüllt, dass auch hier die maximale Leistung rausgeholt hat. Der Prozessor hat aufgrund der -F Kennzeichnung keine Grafikeinheit. Die Frequenz des Prozessors ist ziemlich hoch und bietet auch hier eine sehr zufriedenstellende Leistung. Ich bekomme die CPU nur unter sehr schwierigen Bedingungen auf die Hälfte der Auslastung.
Mein einziger Kritikpunkt hierbei ist der Luftkühler. Die CPU wird zwar nicht zu heiß mit ihm, jedoch ist dieser ziemlich laut und aufgrund dessen würde ich zu einem anderen Luftkühler oder nochj besser einer Wasserkühlung raten.

Come il 12400f con però 4 Ecore in più che probabilmente in ambiente produttivo danno quel pizzico di calcolo in più che non guasta.
Quindi 10 core e 16 threads con un clock di 4Ghz in gaming va molto bene
Come sempre blindatissimo, non è sbloccato, si possono regolare solo le frequenze delle ram, il processore quello è e quello rimane, in questo Intel purtroppo è sempre stata molto tirchia, o prendi la serie K o non cambi neanche una virgola.

You can also recognize Stepping B0 (Raptor Lake) in a better catalog by the S-Spec code, which is SRMBG.

This CPU with 6 hyper-threaded performance cores (12 threads) plus 8 'efficiency' cores (which are pretty fast in their own right) has a total of 20 threads- it's performance is outstanding.

The best part about it is the efficiency, this is a 65W TDP part (boosts to 154W), and whilst idling is only drawing 15-18W. This makes it very easy to cool. In my small form factor case, I'm able to keep the CPU at 25°C-30°C above ambient temperature.

Whilst gaming, I'm yet to see utilisation above 25%. For productivity loads, it chews through most tasks thrown at it with aplomb.

Tout d'abord, ce processeur offre des performances solides pour les tâches quotidiennes et les jeux. Les performances monocœurs sont bonnes et la capacité multithread permet de gérer efficacement les charges de travail plus lourdes. J'ai remarqué une amélioration significative par rapport à mon ancien processeur, ce qui se traduit par une expérience plus fluide et réactive.

Cependant, je dois souligner que le prix de ce processeur est un peu élevé pour l'année 2023. Avec l'évolution rapide de la technologie, il est possible de trouver des processeurs offrant des performances similaires à un prix inférieur. Si vous êtes à la recherche d'un processeur économique, il peut être judicieux de considérer d'autres options sur le marché.

De plus, il est important de noter que ce processeur est basé sur l'architecture Alder Lake, qui est relativement nouvelle. Cela signifie qu'il peut y avoir des problèmes de compatibilité ou des ajustements nécessaires pour certains logiciels ou jeux plus anciens. Assurez-vous de vérifier la compatibilité avec votre configuration avant l'achat.

En conclusion, le processeur Intel Core i5-13500 offre des performances satisfaisantes pour les tâches quotidiennes et les jeux. Cependant, le prix élevé par rapport à d'autres options sur le marché et les éventuels problèmes de compatibilité peuvent être des facteurs à prendre en compte.

Tienes el i5-12400F que es el mejor calidad precio si quieres algo más barato. El i5-13500 (este procesador) si necesitas más potencia es el mejor calidad precio en este rango de precios, y si quieres aún algo más potente (un pelín más) está el i5-13600KF. Estos 3 son los mejores procesadores de la gama media-alta calidad precio.
Dicho esto, este i5-13500 tiene muy buenas temperaturas, con un disipador thermalright Assassin SE de 40€ siempre está a 26 grados, jugando a 30-40 grados y metiéndole mucha caña a 50-60. Cuando haces pruebas de estrés y pones el procesador al máximo durante 10 minutos, la temperatura es de 75-80 grados. Esto también depende de otros factores como la caja y la temperatura ambiente, pero en ningún caso es un procesador caliente, con 40€ refrigeras este bicho. Trae un disipador en la caja (el de intel), pero no lo recomiendo si vas a meterle caña, pues se calienta mucho, en torno a 20-30 grados más.
La prueba cinebench me arroja un resultado de casi 21000 puntos, situándolo justo por debajo actualmente del i7-12700 si no me equivoco, un procesador mucho más caro y que, como se puede observar, tiene prácticamente la misma potencia.

Conclusión: Procesador top calidad-precio. Recomiendo comprar el i5-12400F, el i5-13500 o el i5-13600kf dependiendo del presupuesto.

Attenzione a settare bene il BIOS per questa bestia, vi scrivo qualche accorgimento da avere per evitare problemi: 1) attenzione al profilo di potenza della CPU, se lasciate così comè avrete un PL1 di 115w e un PL2 di 254w (dipende dal produttore della scheda madre, ma bene o male i valori sono questi), il processore così scalderà parecchio... io ho settato il profilo di INTEL (lo trovate tra quelli disponibili nel bios), così ho PL1 65w e PL2 154w e testando ho scoperto di non aver perso prestazioni in alcun modo (al massimo 2/3fps in meno ma dormo la notte lo stesso).
2) SE AVETE GPU AMD: per attivare il RESIZABLE BAR nel bios dovete prima abilitare la voce ''above 4g decoding'', riavviare il pc sempre accedendo al bios e poi attivare il ''resizable bar''... se non lo fate può succedere che la scheda non riesca ad applicare in contemporanea le modifiche di queste due variabili e sarete bloccati in un BOOTLOOP (per uscirne basta resettare il bios facendo fare corto circuito ai due pin sulla scheda madre).

Ma ho fatto uno stress test. Ho provato applicazioni pesanti per la cpu. Stesso risultato: la temperatura andava comodamente sui 100°C e oltre.
Anche il montaggio del cooler una cosa da doversi confessare. Sempre stato abbastanza semplice con questi dissipatori intel ma questo qui non so non entravano bene i pistoncini, una volta entrati non agganciavano, non si capisce il verso dei 4 piedini. Insomma una cosa invereconda. Davvero improponibile.
Ho preso al volo un Noctua neanche troppo costoso. Risultato cpu sotto stress massimo a 73°C. Temperatura ora mentre scrivo 27°. La salute del processore. PC silenzioso al massimo nonostante 8 ventole totali.

Ovvio che richiede un po' di tempo montare un dissipatore decente per cui intel preferisce evidentemente fornire un prodotto che si assembla rapidamente e non occupa spazio.

Ho deciso di acquistare una CPU dell'attuale generazione (13esima) ma con un tetto di spesa di 300€ per non penalizzare le altre componentistiche; la scelta è forzatamente ricaduta sulla serie i5.
Considerando le caratteristiche del primo i7 disponibile per economicità si nota che la differenza di prezzo (+150€) rispetto a questo i5 13500 non è poi così giustificato, quest'ultimo ha certamente il migliore rapporto prezzo/performance.

I thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before I upgraded. Now I see although it was decent, I was missing a lot. My rtx 2080 super didn’t get upgraded this year but I’m sure it’ll need to by next year as it’s now always peaked at 100% in games. While my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground, this 13600k sits around 20-30% usage and around 50 degrees Celsius in most situations.

Depending on the motherboard, you may want to tweak “CPU lite load” settings. My MSI mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current. Now dialed back to mode 9, I have lost no performance what so ever, I actually gained almost a thousand extra points in cinebench by not letting it get hot.

If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i.

A big reason I built a media server in the first place was to store my raw camera footage from storm chasing which is 4k 10bit which creates playback problems on a lot of hardware, it's just too large. I stood up a Plex docker container and added my footage and this CPU handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it's great to go back and easily re-live some of those storms.

We also have a growing library of TV shows and Movies and it also handles streaming those as well.

It's marketed as a value chip for the performance conscious gamer - at least in the reviews I've seen but that misses the mark. At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well.

My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles.

My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back.

My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9. You'll actually be able to keep it cool with a good cooler. I use a Noctua NH-DL12 with it and it's great.",Pattern Name: Processor,"₹46,500"

According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).

Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):
- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings
- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads
- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirector

Note that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).

Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.
Items used in this build:
--
Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/
Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.

Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/
- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/
SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.

Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/
- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.
In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.

Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/
- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:
a)  MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/
b) Intel Core i9-13900KF,  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/
c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.

Item 10)
CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/
- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).

Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/
Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.
---
Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/
- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.

Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/

Z690マザーボードで運用していますがBIOSが対応していれば特に問題なし。最近のマザーボードは電源だけあればBIOS更新可能なので非対応BIOSでも問題ないことが多いです。

デバイスドライバ類は事前に最新に更新（又は新規インストールの場合はダウンロード）しておくことをお勧めします。

CinebenchR23のスコアはマルチ30552、シングル2082。Core i9-12900Kから約1割程度スコアが伸びていて、フルロード時の消費電力は約30Wほど低くなっているのでいい感じです。

10nmと他社の現行製品と比べると２～３世代落ちなプロセスルールで健闘しているとは思いますが、360mm簡易水冷クーラー必須な点はAlder Lakeから変わらず評価が分かれるかと思います。フルロード時のワットパフォーマンスは正直微妙です。

今回取り付けたのはゲーミングPC用なので動画のエンコードなどはさせないため個人的には大満足です。
エンコード処理メインなら大型空冷クーラーで問題なく動作する旧型ですが扱いやすく、価格も安くなっているRyzen 9 5950Xをおすすめします。

I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...
Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died.

I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how.

I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.

I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).

I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.

TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade.

It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD’s expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere.

It CAN run with a low-power or stock-quality cooler for daily tasks, but I'd recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavy-duty loads at it, or good-performance air cooling if you're planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future.",Pattern Name: Core i7 Processor,"₹59,999"

One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot. We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A. We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly. So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.

Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up. We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again. This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.

I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update. After that it boots this CPU just fine.
Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter. I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache. But, it just doesn't compete with this i9. I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores. Even with less cache. The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works. It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD. I use a water cooler, but it's not required. Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.
I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more. But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available. If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you. It will NOT disappoint.

A word on the X790 chipset. You would think they will have better performance because they are newer. They don't. They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update. They have one more USB port. But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.

It seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues. All you need to to is look up the specs for your CPU and setup the BIOS of your motherboard accordingly.

I am using the Aorus Waterforce X 280 with Artic MX-6 Thermal Paste just in case you are curious. This has also been installed on the GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX motherboard.

Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.

I try windows 10.... still issues. I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.

I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code. They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU. They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up. So, i go and pick up the machine.

I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person. We spend 1 hour typing about the issue. I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.

I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket. I open up chat again, i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address. They assign it and forward the support response to me.

And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it. And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.

An OS issue. I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter. I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter. So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.

I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).

I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.

This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.

If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.",,"₹59,100"

I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.

Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.

So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.

I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work.

Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too.

I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.

There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware.

Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs.

User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.

The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).

I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it. I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.

I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.

On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...

If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...

There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash...",,"₹59,100"

I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing. I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.

I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.

Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed. At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM. But testing of different RAM ruled that out. Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue. Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU. Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it. When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner.",,"₹59,100"
