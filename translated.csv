Large applications open like notepad apps.  It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.  If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.  My setup - MSI MPG z790 carbon wifi Intel i9 14900k MSI RTX 4070ti MSI MAG coreliquid liquid cooler Samsung 980 Pro - 1 TB Ripjaws 32gb ddr5  Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you. I got my wiring fixed in matter of minutes ona video call by their assistant."
1,1,2024-03-28,1,79999,India,14900K,I don't liked the price of it . I Also don't liked the performance of it . Rather you can purchase i9 13th generation
2,2,2024-05-16,5,45000,Spain,14600KF,"Good processor that gives you to be able to play and perform office work, video rendering, etc."
3,3,2024-02-23,5,73700,Japan,14900KF,It's early to do anything!As expected!I am very satisfied.
4,4,2024-03-05,5,79999,Canada,14900K,Good decision for my computer
5,5,2024-03-19,5,53000,Italy,14700KF,"This processor is a real power that will meet the needs of gamers, professional users and those who seek maximum performance on their PC.With a basic frequency of 3.6 GHz and a maximum boost frequency of 5.0 GHz allows you to effectively manage heavy workloads, making it ideal for activities such as video rendering, gaming and multimedia production.For the most demanding gamers, the Core ™ I7-14700kf offers extraordinary graphic performance thanks to compatibility with the most recent graphics cards and advanced technologies such as the Intel® Deep Learning Boost, which improves the performance of artificial intelligence in games and in theVirtual reality applications.Personally, I also do a lot of video editing and I have never encountered problems or slowdowns with Davinci Resolve or Premiere.Altino price but unfortunately today the prices are these."
6,6,2023-11-08,4,53000,France,14700KF,"Good surprise on the power of this processor is a monster of power!Crucial point: it heats a lot!I had to put an AIO in 420mm to correctly cool the processor.Second point: it consumes a lot!You always have the possibility of paying a maximum of 125 watts in your BIOS to deal with this (loss of 4-8 % perf).Honestly, if you are a gamer and you don't need raw power, turn to an i5, it will make the trick!"
7,7,2024-01-07,5,53000,Japan,14700KF,Fast shipping. Works as advertised.
8,8,2023-11-03,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,"So far so good. This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset. I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas. I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.  In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games  **Update**  I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling! As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset. If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes. So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.  If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled. But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.  The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be. Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance. My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.  Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."
9,9,2024-05-20,5,79999,Japan,14900K,Processing is fast.
10,10,2024-02-04,5,79999,Canada,14900K,Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
11,11,2024-01-22,5,79999,Germany,14900K,"The Intel i9-14900K is an impressive further development of the i9-12900kf.The noticeable increase in performance that I have experienced is remarkable and shows the progress in technology.The combination with the Asus Apex Encore and the fast 7200 MHz RAM delivers great results, after all, I was able to achieve 41,000 points in the Cinebench R23 without overclocking.The combination offers a solid basis for demanding tasks and gaming.However, one should note that the exact performance can vary depending on the application.Overall, the i9-14900K seems to be a worthwhile investment, even if you were previously owned by the 12th generation."
12,12,2024-05-08,5,79999,the United States,14900K,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it."
13,13,2024-03-13,4,45000,Japan,14600KF,"Although it is almost completely different from 13600K, it is criticized, but there is almost no difference in the price, so I think you can choose which one.In terms of practicality, Pal World is launched with the highest image quality setting (and the maximum number of base pals and ornamental cages are installed), imported from the iPad, imported with OBS with multiple scenes, and at Tiktok Live Studio.Delivery with 1080P60 8000kbps, commenting out (Wan rice, Voicebox, stick reading -chan), and Android's emulator starts this condition.(Use RAM20GB, VRAM9GB) Depending on the composition of parts other than the CPU, I think that it can be said that it is a sufficiently used CPU.Postscript Attached image is a score in which the Pal World is actually launched with the highest image quality setting and various distribution tools are launched."
14,14,2024-04-12,4,53000,Japan,14700KF,To the next generation
15,15,2024-05-10,5,79999,Italy,14900K,"Top processor, truly amazing.Not cheap, but if you need performance this is the right processor."
16,16,2024-05-30,5,79999,Mexico,14900K,"Very good processor, but needs a good refrigeration."
17,17,2024-04-18,5,79999,Japan,14900K,"The performance is wonderful, but the fever is still top class.It is turned with authentic water -cooled (3 30cm radiator*), but if it is still unlimited, the thermal slot ring will be pierced a little.At the rating, it does not go at most 80 degrees, but in the case of unlimited, it will be stable by playing with the voltage VF curve a little.Currently, it is easy to handle at most 89 ° C.However, considering the electricity bill, I think that it is not a good one in the cospa surface.The speed is enough, such as the encoding, but the electricity bill for that amount.I am satisfied with the performance in terms of performance."
18,18,2024-01-22,5,79999,Germany,14900K,The processor is quite expensive and we still favor Intel instead of other manufacturers.The installation of the processor was extremely easy and it delivers exactly the performance we hoped for.There is now rest for the next few years.
19,19,2024-05-08,3,73700,Japan,14900KF,"The game falls as reputation.However, the problem is solved by setting the BIOS and graphics, but it is not for those who are at least for the first time.If you still want it, let's study the settings well."
20,20,2024-03-19,5,79999,the United States,14900K,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"
21,21,2024-06-17,5,79999,Mexico,14900K,"Excellent processor and price, a unloocked comes so you can do overclocking, original packaging, and super fast delivery."
22,22,2024-02-03,3,53000,Japan,14700KF,"It arrived in a paper bag.Although it is a fairly high precision equipment, the rough packing as usual is truly drawn.I don't really recommend buying these precision equipment on Amazon.A big paper bag when you buy an MB.Paper bag when you buy a memory.Of course M.2.I bought it on Amazon because of its simplicity, but I need to change my mind.If you have to buy it on Amazon, choose a manufacturer directly or buy it directly from the store.The performance used is 14GENI7, which is the only performance from 13GEN. I use it with 4070Ti, but both work and games are comfortable.I heard that 14GEN was the last I series and purchased it.Since the GPU is installed anyway, it is attached to F.It is far from purchasing about 10,000 cheaper on sale and is cheaper than K.Since it has never been cheaper, we strongly recommend that you spend your budget on the GPU.With a graphic function, it is helpful to be saved when the GPU is cool, but in my case, when the GPU was squeezed in the past, there were limited things with CPUs alone, so as a result, PC until I purchase a new GPU.I didn't use it.Taking advantage of that experience, I now purchased one GPU with a middle spec.The drawback with F is that if there is no GPU, it will not even touch the screen, so if you make your own or try your own for the first time, you will not be able to confirm the operation unless you consider the order of purchasing.Let's put on.I am satisfied with the product, but the shipping method is bad, so it is ⭐︎3."
23,23,2024-06-13,1,79999,Italy,14900K,"Unreliable seller, I made 3 rendered on this seller because the processors I ordered had defects but not only, also had a kind of square brand outside as if the brand had been reprinted, so intel contact and they tell me it is a lotstrange this and decide to make a replacement that I did not ask but that I thank anyway, and upon arrival of the processor replaced directly by Intel I notice that this square mold is different practically does not exist, the sanding on the product was different .. what can I say, they areAlways retailers.I do not recommend it."
24,24,2024-03-20,3,45000,Japan,14600KF,"I tried to limit the power at 160W with a simple water cooling of the cooler master, but when I played a video with a cursor on YouTube, the temperature rises suddenly. The temperature is stable for playing normally."
25,25,2024-05-03,1,79999,Canada,14900K,"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal. I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card. I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage. Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate. Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again. This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.  I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.  I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.  I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessor  I had to purchase 2 rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.  I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."
26,26,2024-04-09,5,79999,Mexico,14900K,"Of the best processors in the market.Excellent for any type of demanding task.But it is important to combine it with a good liquid cooling or will have thermal neck.I had to ask for it 2 times because the first one had a very common hardware error in these processors, a problem in shaders compilation that crrashea in some games or programs.The second I asked came without any problem."
27,27,2024-01-23,3,79999,Japan,14900K,"simply!The performance and stability are satisfied.If you look at a model with an i9, there is no difference in performance on the bench, so the same thing of the 13th generation may be better.Even if you do OC, you can not feel the difference in performance with 13 generations ..."
28,28,2023-10-29,1,79999,Canada,14900K,Consumption up to 320 W too dear value for money
29,29,2024-04-04,5,79999,the United States,14900K,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.  For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—  Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.  When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.  The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...  Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.  As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.  The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...  We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""  Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees. Just having fun, do what you love!  I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!  Note: Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours. I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage.... Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth."
30,30,2024-06-18,5,45000,Mexico,14600KF,Very good.
31,31,2023-12-07,5,79999,the United States,14900K,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.  I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)  If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly. I typically stay in the high 50's or low 60's during 4K gaming. This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80⁰ occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"
32,32,2024-02-18,5,73700,Mexico,14900KF,"I got in perfect condition, the processor had written exactly what I asked for: I9 14900kf.He arrived fast and packed."
33,33,2024-01-11,4,73700,the United States,14900KF,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use. After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result. I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v. I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE. this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully. It basically throttles the chip.  I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out. Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine. I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive. It does run HOT even with water cooling. IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5. Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.  Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use. Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing. HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300. So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.  System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core. Disabled in BIOS now. Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080ti  So the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me. That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."
34,34,2024-02-11,5,79999,the United States,14900K,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.  i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.  ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.  yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.  here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores  1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black 2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it) 3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans) 4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat) 5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps) 6.

(note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.  i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.  personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("
35,35,2024-05-22,5,79999,the United States,14900K,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is why Even if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds. I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZ I get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees. I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case. Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come . Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them . I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issue Not a blue screen Just underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .

The fan would increase and decrease speed depending on the load, and it literally made the processor wait for the fan--at least that's how it seemed. Slowed everything down and made a lot of unnecessary noise. With my new Intel-based system, those issues are gone, and I have a lightning fast PC. Learned my lesson about AMD!"

While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers. When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet. Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."

50,50,2024-04-05,3,79999,the United States,14900K,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to i9-14900K . It's OK but I can't rave over it. It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.  The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K. For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen. Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K. Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful. I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.  I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures. Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better. Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C). I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing. A second one became slightly flaky.  I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display. But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me. If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays. IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.  The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night. On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package. It took literally 6 months to get a refund. That was rather irksome."

52,52,2024-04-05,5,73700,the United States,14900KF,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor. The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad. Enjoying my thermal right air cooler it does a great job for half the cost of my older noctua cooler on my prior haswell i7.

Intel was very good at getting a refund sent via RMA, although it took awhile. I purchased this version instead and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my issues resolved. The CPU can handle almost everything thrown at it. Certainly a good purchase and better than the 13th gens that seem to have more issues."

After upgrading from a Ryzen 3700x to this, my work speed, gaming, everything cannot lay a finger on this thing. The only time's i've seen this truly cap out is during extreme compression, decompression, and specific rendering situations. The only con which isn't truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly HOT. If you're going to get this? I would absolutely suggest a 360 AIO cooler or you're going to experience thermal throttling, or even thermal shutdowns. That was my original issue, but quickly upgraded coolers, and this thing is a MONSTER."

All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version."

70,70,2024-02-17,4,79999,the United States,14900K,As a Gamer/Data Scientist/Programmer/Tinker I wanted a mainstream CPU built by a well established company. With Intel's i9-14900K CPU I have a top of the line general purpose chip which provides above average performance in all the computational fields I have an interest in. I only gave it a 4-star rating because I had hoped that Intel would have brought the 15th generation chips out in 2023 Q4 as they said rather than just the mobile chips.
71,71,2023-10-22,5,79999,the United States,14900K,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.  The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.  While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.  If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."

Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother. It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."

If you have a 12th Gen, it might be worth it to you if you need that extra performance but really depends on what you do.  If you are on 11th Gen or below and were looking to upgrade, you might as well get a 14700K or 14900K or KF as they are similarly priced with the 13th gen processors.  Also, the 14700K has a 4 more E cores and higher clock speeds which can result in 10-20% performance gains depending on the workload compared to the 13700K.

90,90,2024-03-25,5,24000,India,11400F,"I bought this i5 11400f in 2023 and still it does its job with no sweat. Well my purpose is editing in premier pro and gaming @1080p resolution. Paired with rtx 3060, its a beast at 1080p. Played competitive games and high graphics intense games like forza horizon 5 etc etc... Does its job fine. A common statement is intel processor's heat better than amd processors, well it is true. It heats very well, stock cooler not enough, my pc even shut downed 3 times when playing high end games used with stock cooler. A decent air cooler is enough to calm down this one, it is not unlocked in fact, so no explanation needed i guess. If u are gonna build a new pc build in 2024 or onwards , please consider 12th gen atleast because u can have great future upgradability chance. When said all these, i took this over 12400f because i felt this enough for my needs and it didn't disappointed me. When considering it is just an i5 i got flabbergasted by its performance fr. Many people say 11th gen is bad but i felt it as worthy for the money i spent and im not gonna do upgrades in future so... Yeah overall it is a good product and im happy with it👍. Once again, don't even consider any of 11th gen processors if u are gonna pc build in 2024 and future because 13th gen and 12 th gen is way more future proof that this 11th gen. So yeah that's it."

For having 6 cores it surprised me how well it performs on FPS games, does better than many 8 Core CPUs . This i5-11400f seems very snappy with Decent frame rates at 1080p and 1440. Maybe a perfect match for an Nvidia 3060 gpu or Radeon 6700 gpu or Maybe an Intel Arc A750 gpu. This CPU is not Top Teir Cutting edge but if you are building an entry level 1080p Gaming pc like i was or maybe a mid tier 1440p gaming setup and limited on funds this Cpu could be a nice Option."

Everything works/booted fine, no issues - you will need your own graphics card (salvaged mine) for better resolution and a fan cooler (again salvaged); intel coolers are not the best. All in all a good processor for office work (not for gaming - get an Core i7 for that)."

111,111,2022-02-25,5,24000,Singapore,11400F,"Noticed that the price of 11400(F) has dropped quite significantly since the launch of Alder Lake. For the price of quality B560M motherboard and the CPU, it is a value choice."
112,112,2022-12-07,5,24000,Japan,11400F,"Unless you frequently ask for CPU replacement or Kodawari.Since this CPU, which has become cheaper due to the delay, and the ASUS gaming motherboard that happened to be less than 10,000, it was a little cheaper than the 12th generation of Corei3 and the low -priced motherboard.I am satisfied with the performance."
113,113,2024-06-03,5,24000,the United States,11400F,Easy install and works great. Much faster than a previous tenth generation i3.
114,114,2023-05-05,3,24000,Canada,11400F,Doesn’t perform as well as I would expect for $200 plus the stock cooler is completely useless I would strongly advise an aio because with the stock cooler on moderate usage the cpu was way over temp
115,115,2024-01-24,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,"I exceed my expectations, the difference with an i3 processor is noticeable, with a 2060TI video card the graphics are very good"

119,119,2023-07-11,4,24000,the United States,11400F,"the cpu is great for gaming, I use it only for that but the stock coolers is really bad, when first installed got temps about 90-95 celsius while gaming and had to check online for help, it turned out to be a bios setting (dont remember the exact name of the option, but I understand most gaming high end motherboards come with it eneabled) that makes it always go boosted clocks and therefore hot temps, disabled it and got temps down to 70-75 while gaming wich is still hot for my likes but I guess it's acceptable for the stock cooler.  soon getting it a liquid cooler, but mostly for aesthetics, a decent air cooler will do the job"
120,120,2023-07-22,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,Everything arrived well and on time
121,121,2023-02-05,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,"An excellent and more than enough processor for mid -range video cards and even some high -end.With the processor I have an RX 6650 XT and it is excellent and even left over in any game or program.I am a video editor and I have several windows open at the same time and several processes running in the background and I have never had problems.The only bad thing is the stock fan, it serves the basics, but it feels of poor quality."
122,122,2024-05-15,5,24000,the United States,11400F,"Initially I thought it was gonna be a bad product and its gonna be broken due to the distance it has to go, but it has worked exceptionally well"
123,123,2024-06-04,5,24000,the United States,11400F,"It yields very well for games and basic tasks, with a good graphics card and cooling, it is enough."
124,124,2021-12-30,5,24000,Japan,11400F,It is used in water -cooled and is very stable.It can be driven around 4.2GHz and the cospa is the best.I would like to consider the heat problem after overcoming the harsh environment in the summer.
125,125,2023-01-28,4,24000,Mexico,11400F,"I consider that it is the best processor for this price, and even more if you have a good graph, although this processor does not make a bottleneck with high -end graphics"
126,126,2022-10-17,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,"Although this processor is last year, it is still in the sweet point.For gaming, i5 exceed the i3, but from i5 to i7 it is almost the same, I repeat, this is in gaming, because for productive tasks there is more difference.Anyway, with this processor, 4K photo and video editing can be made without problems.I chose this over generation 12 because an i5 12400F would have barely given a 10-15% better performance, but the price of the processor and motherboard were for much cheaper"
127,127,2023-07-21,5,24000,the United States,11400F,"For the price, this is a great CPU. Be aware that this chip does not have built in graphics, so you'll need one.  This worked perfect for my budget build I did with my son for his first gaming PC. You can't overclock it, but it does max out at 4.4 GHz and the 6 cores makes it work faster than I expected. Paired with a decent GPU and this chip is more than enough for a decent system."
128,128,2022-09-26,3,24000,Japan,11400F,"I was satisfied with the function, but the box was too tattered."
129,129,2023-09-03,5,24000,Mexico,11400F,Super recommended to assemble your middle range PC

137,137,2023-08-22,5,24000,the United States,11400F,I bought this based on performance to price for my second PC. I was going to use a 10000 series CPU but discovered that using the 11400 utiilizes the features on my motherboard better. This one works very well with my motherboard.
138,138,2022-05-13,5,24000,the United States,11400F,"I have been using my 11400F for a few months now and I couldn't be happier with it, it's not a top of the line processor when compared to others of the same generation or the competition but for $150 Intel came in clutch with a great value for money to all budget gamers.  I haven't yet found a game where this processor struggles or bottlenecks my graphics card and for daily usage/keeping things opened in the background it is literally a king. If you are upgrading from an older generation intel it will blow your mind how much faster processors have gotten over the years!  All in all, I am happy with my purchase and will have this bad boy last me for a while."
139,139,2023-02-27,4,24000,the United States,11400F,"The processor is excellent but you will need to buy a more power discipler if or yes, with the smallest that you force the PC it will reach temperatures of +85 ° which will make the PC turn off to avoid damage, when you buy a decent disciplerYou can play and use it without any problem"
140,140,2023-07-25,5,24000,the United States,11400F,"I had my doubts, I saw reviews, technical specifications, game tests and performance, but things are different when you have it in your hand, I assembled my computer with this processor and I can say that it was a good choice."

144,144,2023-07-15,5,24000,the United States,11400F,This CPU is 11th generation Intel 1200 LGA. It is very fast. I upgraded from an LGA 1155. So I am very happy with my purchase. No issues regarding this CPU.
145,145,2023-08-23,5,24000,the United States,11400F,Although I have to buy another dissipator is it worth it

155,155,2022-07-25,4,24000,the United States,11400F,"For the price, you can’t beat that. I was getting a bit of bottlenecking with my 6th gen i5 6600k. So this cpu definitely out classes that. Not a crazy CPU but is worth it for the money."

162,162,2023-01-16,5,24000,the United States,11400F,From one it is better to go for this instead of the i3.Prices are already lower than before so this 6 cores.

Intel® Core™ i7-11700K does, therefore was a no brainer to purchase this specific CPU as MSI updated the motherboard BIOS to support Intel Gen 11. And as Intel® Core™ i7-11700K comes with integrated graphics, I use this to my advantage to run certain programs to run from my 3080 GPU and Intel integrated graphics as I do with MSFS 2020. I was concern with the CPU heat but it turns out that runs at 34 normal load with water cooler and 70 when running under heavy stress loads. Very happy and satisficed with this purchase. 100% recommended."

I think at this price (I got it at pre-launch sale of $399) it's a good product. It's cheaper than the 5800X, performs very close to it and is a lot more fun to Overclock. Rocket Lake (11th gen) supports specific core overclocks to dial in ratios for the two best cores and other less hot cores. It also can take a tad bit more voltage than skylake++++ (1.45V load voltage supposedly safe according to Reddit AMA) although running at slightly lower all core clocks than comet lake with improved IPC. This actually seems to run slightly cooler for me but power draw can be pretty nuts on stress tests. Gaming load is not bad at all I was seeing around 100w on Horizon Zero Dawn. Unless you want the highest overclocks, the i7 can still get you pretty close or above the stock clocks of the i9 with manual tuning without the price premium and similar real world performance. Coming from the i9-10900k, the gaming FPS is pretty similar at UW 1440p, but rocket lake seems much more stable with overclocking - as in you get watch dog BSOD errors or you don’t - not the WHEA stuff. The RAM gear stuff is a little overblown, the performance penalty of running 1:2 is not as bad as what you see on Ryzen. You can run very high speed ram 4800+ and looser timings and get a ton of performance from these chips. I'm an enthusiast and I've had Ryzen and Intel systems and I just enjoy tuning Intel CPUs. Glad to be one of the first to review this. This came in as same day delivery! Happy overclocking everyone."

But if money is a consideration. Or your power bill. Or how much you need to spend on cooling. Or what AMD offers. Well, you can do better. The similar AMD 8 core is a bit more expensive but has cheaper motherboards and draws far less power which means a smaller power bill, a smaller power supply and cheaper cooling solutions.  So, yes this processor is strong. I wanted to go Intel and needed a processor right away so that's why I own one. But I feel like this is an offering to bridge the gap to the next generation."

I can't play my full Steam library, but I can use a good 85%. I can do everything else that I normally do without any overheating or slowdowns.

To name a few: GRIM DAWN,DIVINITY ORIGINAL SIN, TRIALS OF MANA, and BOOK OF DEMONS. No separate graphics card at all. As far as I'm concerned, this processor is well worth the money.

I have changed nothing. I reseated my cooler thinking maybe it had shifted and that still didn't fix it. I am going to check through everything today, maybe something changed in my bios for some reason. If this can't be fixed I'll be sending it back or warrantying it  So far so good, I've been able to run this at 5.2Ghz on all cores for quite a while, gets a little warm but nothing that isn't manageable.

And for Intel to top it, is impressive in itself. CPU if you pair it with the right motherboard and rams you will then see its full potential. I own the 12900K for over 6 months and decided to go back to the 11gen. Even though Alder lake is more powerful, since it is very new, it has way too many drawback and the high latency of rams is the main reason why I decided to sell it. I think Raptor lake would be the CPU but as of now, the 11 gen with a few tweaks will outperform alder lake."

228,228,2021-05-06,4,58500,the United States,11700K,Great for gaming. Even tho AMD beats it in multi core workloads doesn't mean it's not a good processor. It's a stable reliable processor. And best of all it's in stock. In gaming it trades blows with my ryzen 5800x. So for I haven't run into any bugs or glitches. That's what you get with intel. Stability. If your only gaming I'd say this isn't the way to go. But my wife does do work station application and the extra cores reduce her time. I'd say this is niche processor and very few people would actually benefit from the extra cores. If your just gaming go with a 11600k. My daughter build is running an overclocked 11600k and it trades blows with this one.

A learning curve on overclocking since 2010, I spent equally as much in ram, mobo and cooling but worth every cent. You'll still need graphics if running under GeForce 1000 Series, but my perfermance with a 960Gtx is phenomenal. Its an Intel entusiasts dream, and I agree: ignore the one star reviews. I won't make a Ryzen comparison, other than my title, I do believe AMD is doing less with more changes but just my opinion. Are threads, cores and nanometers winning? I have my doubts. Nonetheless this is Intel back on it's game!"
233,233,2021-05-21,5,58500,the United States,11700K,Wonderfully designed CPU. For those that want low power consumption and low temps just leave it stock. The 3.6 Ghz to 5.0 boost is designed to make this processor the Swiss Army Knife of CPUs. Overclocks to 5.1 all-core easily on the Z590 motherboards. Yes it runs warm but you wanted an excuse to buy that 360mm AIO. Two cores can overclock to 5.2 if desired. Probably could get all 8 pretty close to that with an open loop system. Scores 116-118% on userbenchmarks. I like AMD but they just don't overclock as well. Plus this processor is readily available at retail price. Some of the hate surrounding this offering is extremely misguided.

The only ""game"" I run is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 which runs at almost the maximum settings."
236,236,2022-08-23,5,58500,the United States,11700K,"Despite the stigma with the 11th Gen CPUs, the performance of the 11700K is definitely worth going for. The only scenario I would say it's not recommended is if the 12600K/12700K is available for a close price, in which case one would have to account for the additional cost with the Z690 motherboards as well as DDR5 if that's the choice."

This is also paired with an rtx 3070 in my system and I could not be happier. I have it pinged at 5.0 ghz and it has not let me down at all. Definitely have so much more room to overclock if I want too which is nice. This cpu is very stable and I think the best value in terms of price to performance on the intel 11th gen lineup."
241,241,2022-04-30,4,58500,the United States,11700K,"For some reason it wouldn’t allow me to unlock the RAID capability on my motherboard since this model was made to do that. Tested with someone else’s 11700 it raid could be enabled. I wouldn’t buy it here, look elsewhere for it. It’s too expensive to risk something like this."

263,263,2024-03-10,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Upgraded from a 9900k and had a hotter running PC. Couldn't figure it out at first and found myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc. After research I was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps. What ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the Performance Menu.  In those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99% my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80-85. This tuning comes without a noticeable hit on FPS except while playing ""Squad"" (a single core use cpu intensive game). With that game I do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99%. This is not that big of a deal as I can easily tick it up to 100% for Squad and just put up with the 75-80 temps!  Happy that I can at least play most of my games at a good temp while gaining good performance by this upgrade!"
264,264,2022-03-26,5,80000,Germany,11900K,No issue with cpu works. temps are fine for workload.

276,276,2023-10-03,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"This was Intel's top line CPU in the 11th generation; it used the LGA-1200 socket which was only minimally different from the LGA-1151 socket (1200 pins vs. 1151 pins). The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200. By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs. This i9-11900K will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100%, and that's right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today."
277,277,2023-04-03,5,80000,the United Kingdom,11900K,"Im mostly just confused why the free heatsink thats not designed for this CPU that is known to run extremely hot.... also, saddened by the lack of a fancy looking intel box :D"
278,278,2023-11-06,1,80000,France,11900K,"On paper, it is a very good CPU that I recommend to anyone.However, having bought it from this seller, I have only had problems since I received it.The packaging was not the blue box you see in the photos but a cardboard packaging with foam, probably supplied by Amazon, with just the CPU inside, in direct contact of the foam.Not immediately but a little after its installation (after the warranty period, as if by chance), the CPU is now almost unusable, since the computer is constantly 100% use of it, or works correctly with100%peaks.Worse still, playing games is a torture, since the PC is simply freeze and crash when it wishes, with this damn CPU.If you want to buy this CPU at all costs, do not do it here, go through a real seller with a follow -up and a guarantee, or you will throw hundreds of euros by the window."

283,283,2024-04-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"I am not a gamer by a long shot, but wanted a powerful Intel based CPU riding on an 'Asus Maximus Extreme Motherboard' along with a Asus RTX 4090 GPU. I purchased (1) of the most graphic intensive AAA game titles and a few CPU intensive military strategy simulation games known for their heavy demand for CPU physics computations. My Core i9-11900K which I purchased in 2022 performed admirably well on all accounts. Absolutely no complaints. Some reports say that the i9-11900K runs hot and sometimes above the 100°C mark? But that was not really the case with me or the many others when they installed a high quality 360mm or above sized AIO water cooler. My very demanding combat simulation (Command: Modern Operations) never presented a heating issue with the i9-11900K and with my over 80-hours of heavy duty play. For good measure my Cosmos C700M EATX case also includes a total of (7) additional independent Noctua cooling fans, which of course benefits the cooling within the massive interior of the enclosure. Overall I am extremely satisfied with INTEL in general and recommend the i9-11900K and or its newer siblings now as a very good buy!"

287,287,2024-01-31,5,80000,the United States,11900K,This LGA 1200 cpu is robust and easy to overclock assuming your motherboard supports overclocking and your cpu cooler supports it. The base 3.5 GHz can easily support overclocking to 5GHz. I used the Intel Windows overclocking program and it was easy to do. The cpu installs easily and runs well.
288,288,2023-09-04,5,80000,Canada,11900K,Worked great in my home built pc.

I did install water cooling because it does run warm, but let’s just say this. My computer now works at warp 9.975. With the i9 10900k, a Nvidia 3060/12gb, and 128 GB DDR4 at 3200mhz, on userbenchmark website the lowest score I got was a 104% for gaming (UFO ranking). I overclock it a lot and it holds up well, and stays under 50c with the water cooling for me.  11/10, would recommend, promote ahead of peers."

But cpuZ is reading i9-11900k. So that’s good."

298,298,2022-10-16,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"when i upgraded my desktop i decided to go intel core i9 this time. all my previous build was a 6th generation core i7 6700k. it ran fine but it wasnt up to running windows 11. so an upgrade was in order. besides, my old board was starting to fail. i originally bought a 10th generation core i9 10 core but that cpu was junk. there wasnt enough PCI-e Lanes to support my drives and usb devices. this is a limitation of 10th generation CPUs not a limitation on the board. my video card (RTX 3070) took up most of the available PCI-e lanes which took out most of my drives. so i went to the 11th generation i9 8 core instead. very happy with it. it solved all my PCI-e lane issues. i am able to run all my devices and drives. the cpu clocks at 5.3ghz stable i have water cooling installed. i see zero problems with this chip. its fast, its stable im plenty happy with the upgrade. the board is a MSI MEG z590 ACE Gold. i have 64gb DDR4 3200."
299,299,2024-03-18,3,80000,the United States,11900K,"A great processor for my PC to complete its upgrade (highest compatible for my motherboard), but even with water-cooling, it was running too hot, my computer would need to shutdown. Swapped back to my i7-10700 with no issues.  While my computer was running the i9, it made everything very optimized, including being able to utilize my 4070 graphics card to its fullest. I may get another one to try again, heard these can vary slightly on production."

This is the newest of the new guys, if you get this cpu do it proper, if youre not gonna shoot for utilizing its capabilities then get a 10th gen and save money. Youre gonna need a new board, water cool this thing, gen 4 nvme drive, new 30 series gpu's (cause they utilize gen 4 pci-e slots) heres a simple breakdown of a good starting point when getting this cpu:  Step 1: get an 11th gen processor (this i9 if its in your budget) Step 2: get a motherboard with gen 4 pcie slots (z590-e was my go to) Step 3: obviously water cool this unlocked beauty cause it'd be a shame not to get it to 5.3ghz (done safely with corsair's H150i elite capellix; hovers around 40's in degrees Celsius) Step 4: get a gen 4 nvme solid slate drive (might as well go samsung 980 pro for the 7000mb/s reads) Step 5: enjoy windows booting and being able to start opening webpages and games within 5 seconds of pressing the power button and never waiting for anything to load ever again 🙌🙏  ⚡ This is the future ⚡"
302,302,2024-01-09,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Had this for a while and it's performing like it should. Would buy it again.
303,303,2021-07-24,5,80000,the United States,11900K,The seller did an amazing job. The item came even sooner than expected. The bad news is that I installed it in my previously flawless running machine. The reason I upgraded from my current i910900k is that I wanted to enable the NVME.2 4.0 on my SSD. I already had the drive and a Z590 motherboard so why not right? I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error. (This is caused by CPU cores failing to communicate with each other.) I called Intel tech support who was less than help full. I updated all drivers and still didn't work. I did notice my CPU temp was running over 100c. Odd because I have the best nactura CPU cooler they sell. I decided to upgrade to a liquid CPU cooler and that brought my CPU temp down to around 85c. That still didn't fix the time out errors. I put my old CPU back and all is happy. I ended up sending the i9 11900k back but at least my i9 10900k is nice and cool even at 45% overclock. LOL
304,304,2022-08-29,4,80000,the United States,11900K,"The tenth gen i9 is better than this one, but I got it because my mobo needed it for the m.2 slot to work. That being said, we're talking about small performance differences in top of the line components, so it's not a big deal. With this thing being $650 without a sale I would never buy it because I can get an i7 from the same gen or previous and it will be just as good. I will say that the photo is deceptive, it does not come in the package on the photo with the cool blue plastic box. It will come in a cardboard box like any other CPU. Overall it's still a great CPU and is a great upgrade from my previous i5 8600k, but not the absolute best and not worth paying $600 for."
305,305,2022-10-07,4,80000,the United States,11900K,"CPU is great. Not a bad deal if you are building a budget oriented high end PC. Performance is similar to the 10900k but has the PCIe gen 4 support which is the only justification for this CPU existance. This with a new z590 and depending if you already have DDR4 ram, this is 1/3 the cost of a new 12th existence. I will admit I am very disappointed in the box. The nice fancy one pictured is not the one sent. Instead you will receive your processor in a small cardboard box with Intel branding. It should be make clear that the box in the picture will not be arriving in the description or by updating the imgages."
306,306,2023-03-30,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Products operates as expected, but they shipped this really oddly. It was first shipped ups, and stayed in a picked up status for 2 days. Then a day or so later, delivered to usps. Sat in Des Moines IA for 4 days. Then it crawled to me well after predicted time. Don't ship this way. Its the worst way too ship. Also you shipped it in a Thin bubble wrap bag. Should have been in a box. Its a fragile chip, but thank you for a good working product with no issues as of yet."
307,307,2022-09-06,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"I purchased this CPU during one of Amazon's infrequent and short-lived major price reductions. I paid $301.99 for the CPU at the time when it was selling for $389.99. I wanted PCIe 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4.0 and I was considering a 5900X but I found the AMD X570 motherboard feature sets to be disappointing even at the high end. Anyway, I usually buy Intel Processors although I've occasionally bought AMD in the past. I have a very good Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360 CPU Liquid Cooler which keeps the temperatures reasonably cool. I also bought an ASUS Z590 MAXIMUS XIII HERO motherboard, everything is faster with this CPU and motherboard, from storage to graphics."
308,308,2022-11-26,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Having eight cores and hyperthreading makes for a very powerful processor. This is a very good ""overkill"" processor; that is to say, if you get this you'll outpace software for several years. It also has onboard graphics, so if you're buying this for rendering and just light computing, you'll be okay and won't have to buy a discrete graphics card like a GeForce.  That said, this thing can sometimes get warm under heavy use, so a cooler is recommended. I use a liquid cooler, but if you're not using it for heavy gaming, you can get away with just a fan.  Overall, 10/10."
309,309,2023-04-28,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"As others stated it is not in the box being shown, so the advertised product is not what you get.  However the good thing is the box doesnt mean squat to how it runs. Just grabbed this to upgrade my system from a 10th gen i9 to this, only difference really is faster pcie slots on my board (this would depend on your board) and opens up an additional nvme drive."
310,310,2023-09-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Been using this CPU for about a year works great.  Seen some reviews about the box issue but I received mine in the official intel box.

313,313,2022-12-14,4,80000,the United States,11900K,"This CPU is hot and I don't just mean fast, it runs pretty hot even with liquid cooling. But with the right MB, cooling and RAM I think 5ghz may be reachable, pushing it but reachable."
314,314,2022-07-25,5,80000,the United States,11900K,So far I’m really liking this cpu. I purchased it on prime day for $300 which imo isn’t too bad compared to what it used to be and how expensive the 12 gen cpus are.  Paired it with the z590 asus strix E that i got for $200 on prime days. It’s working out pretty well.  Also threw in the 3600 cl16 ram with it as this ram apparently runs well with it.  Overall I’m pretty happy with this purchase
315,315,2022-11-17,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Installed the i9 11900k in the ASUS Prime Z590-P WiFi6 with Team group DDR4 3200 CL14 and ASUS RTX 2070 has this computer running less than a whisper of sound I mean even when the PC ramps up to 5.3GHz then you hear still a whisper from all fans you really need to pay attention to the PC to even notice any sound at all.
316,316,2021-06-19,4,80000,the United States,11900K,"This cpu is fast for gaming but for some reason it was crashing I check everything on my Rig to be compatible and it was, put a different cpu and problems are gone am not sure if it was defective or what but other than the crashing out of nowhere with the one I had excellent cpu, now let’s see how it goes with the return will edit once everything is handled I had a little experience with Amazon that I dnt wish to no body still waiting on that for few months already"
317,317,2021-06-03,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"This CPU is fast, really fast. Remove the power limits and let it's boost algorithms take over and it will blow your socks off. You will need a good AIO or really beefy air cooler (or obviously a custom loop). I went with the Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML240 Illusion, ordered an extra 2 of the Hallo Fans and set it up in a Push/Pull and under stress test8ng it stays in the 80s (with all power limits removed) while gaming it is usually in the 50's and occasionally the 60's if it is really intense.  It is a tad on the pricey end but you want almost the same performance for less grab the 11700k"
318,318,2023-02-20,4,80000,the United States,11900K,4 star because I didn't get the fancy box
319,319,2022-09-11,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Right now the best processors out there. In a few months I'm sure there will be better ones.

Sorry, it's the way of the world."
320,320,2023-08-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Good product except for freight charges being costly.
321,321,2021-08-26,1,80000,the United States,11900K,"It does not worth buying this CPU. It is really expensive. I would expect it to be a good performance and good quality CPU and has good service, but it doesn't match my expectations. It is broken 10 days after I used it. My computer was certainly not able to open. After I google the issues and take it to a computer store, it seems like the CPU is broken and there are many defective merchandises in this product. So far, I am not happy but still can convince myself that I am just not lucky even I feel ridiculous about why such expensive items have so many defective products. I tried to use the warranty to get a new one or fix it, but Intel's customer service is ridiculous slow. After we tell them the issue, it has been a month and they are still verifying our information. it took them 4 days to reply us and told us what info they need. We sent them the information immediately. It took another 4 days to tell us that one of the information is wrong. We gave them the correct information immediately. This time, it took 10 days to tell us that purchase information is good, but they need the account holder to authorize the warranty (why do not you tell us this at beginning?). After this, it has been several days and we still wait for the reply now. I do not understand why it takes so many days to just verify the customer information. Should not this be done in 1 days or even 1 hour? I understand it takes time to reply and communicate cross teams, but it still takes too long time. Especially, this is a high price item, it should have proper quality and service for this price."
322,322,2022-09-25,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Got this on sale for 46% off a couple weeks ago and it made such a fantastic performance increase from my i7 7700k! Paired it with a MSI Z590-A PRO Series motherboard, 32 GB DDR4 3200 MHz RAM, MSI VENTUS 2X 3060 Ti GPU, and a Cooler Master 240L water cooling system and it's been absolutely incredible!"
323,323,2023-05-20,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"I wish Intel would end this ""Upgrade or Die"" philosophy it really makes me unhappy. My mom's cool with it tho."
324,324,2023-03-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Excellent to work to play and demand the maximum of the processor, I had to update my mainboard (Z590) to take advantage of all the resources of the easy to install processor, if I recommend installing a good dissipator because it tends to heat up."
325,325,2022-07-15,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Runs flawlessly on default settings on this rog strix z590-e. It over clocks itself to 5.3ghz all core if you really need it. Paired it with a corsair h100i 240mm and it doesn't go above 65c during heavy gaming. If you're going to overclock it I suggest a 360mm AIO or custom loop.
326,326,2022-07-13,5,80000,the United States,11900K,I added this Intel Core i9-11900K Desktop Processor to my new 'ROG Maximus XIII Hero motherboard' a year ago. It is a perfect combination for what I wanted = gaming in VR.  I haven't needed Tech Support so that says a lot about the quality of this and the motherboard working together.
327,327,2022-09-22,4,80000,the United States,11900K,Does not come with the fancy box. Does not come with a cpu fan that comes with the fancy box. It's bare bones.
328,328,2024-01-14,2,80000,the United States,11900K,The cpu worked and it is an 11900k but it came in a regular brown box not an intel box which was concerning as it may be used.
329,329,2023-01-06,3,80000,the United States,11900K,"I've had this cpu since April of 2022 and just the other day my PC would only start the fans and the lights in the pc, after switching some parts and testing it turned out the cpu has gone bad. It did perform well while it was working but for a cpu that was not overclocked or used for anything more than gaming it shouldn't go bad like this."
330,330,2022-04-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Just upgraded my pcs motherboard so I figured might as well get a new processor while im at it. So far the difference is immense, my pc boots faster than its monitor can turn on and playing games at max settings with unlocked framerates causes 0 stress on my rig now. So far soooo good."
331,331,2023-05-28,3,80000,the United States,11900K,"I was sent a lose used possessor in a box. Annoyed, but no choice apparently."
332,332,2022-04-20,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Constantly running around 45-65C max full load gaming with 240MM AIO from NZXT. This holds 4.9-5.2 GHz constantly I may have won the silicon lotto. This runs 1440P games yawning with a 3080Ti maybe 50-60 percent utilization under heavy games. If you don’t want to go 12th gen this is your CPU.
333,333,2022-09-08,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"At one time, I thought this I9-11900K could not be used. After cross-testing with multiple PCs, it can finally be used. This CPU was purchased at a special price, the CP value is very high, and the seller sends it quickly."
334,334,2022-08-15,5,80000,the United States,11900K,I waited a year for this processor it was worth the wait coming off a FX chip. Delivery was in less then a day only 10 hours biting my nails couldn't wait to get this chip
335,335,2021-10-18,4,80000,Canada,11900K,"A bit expensive.  Powerful, but runs VERY hot, to the point you might crash your PC due to heat."
336,336,2022-10-16,5,80000,Canada,11900K,Upgraded from i5....LOL what a friggin improvement....Wow Video editing sure isn't an issue now. Blows my mind
337,337,2022-09-28,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"My daughter needs new computer system. So, I try this CPU for her computer. So far so good."
338,338,2022-08-09,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Great cpu. Super fast and great overclocking. Paired it with a quality AIO and it keeps the temps down.
339,339,2022-09-09,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Built a good spec pc with this cpu and Asus z-590 e gaming board. Works like a dream
340,340,2023-02-13,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Very powerful CPU. Great product!
341,341,2022-03-05,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"I9 is outrageous. Better benchmarks than my old PC that had an older 5.0ghz amd (older am3+ socket) with crossfire r9 390x. Shipping was next day, arrived new!"
342,342,2021-11-08,3,80000,the United States,11900K,"Good for gaming. Definitely runs hot, even a 360mm AIO can’t keep it cool with ABT enabled. Frequently hits 100C when stress testing with ABT on AVX loads. During gaming with ABT with a 350mm AIO 50-70C. Also has an issue that the cores report 0C when in C states. Intel says there’s a “fix” coming but there’s no official timeline."
343,343,2022-07-05,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Exactly what I needed for my pc build! This item is AMAZING! and performs even better
344,344,2021-06-04,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Not sure why there are so few reviews for this product. Also not sure why it's listed under motherboards. It's an amazing cpu for gaming and lightly-threaded workloads. Don't listen to reviews about it not working or being too hot, people are just bad mounting coolers and making sure the socket fits."
345,345,2022-07-13,5,80000,the United States,11900K,To date the CPU works very well for what ever you want it to do.
346,346,2021-11-23,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Intel quality is an industry standard (in my eyes) & this is no exception. Installation and setup were EASY and a good speed bump. Windows 11 seems to love it.
347,347,2022-10-11,5,80000,the United States,11900K,"Was an AMD guy, now I'm an Intel believer."
348,348,2022-02-11,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Great processor if you want to use pci-e 4.0 features like your samsung pro 980 nvme 4.0 ssd or pci-e 4.0 compatible Video Cards.
349,349,2022-08-18,5,80000,the United States,11900K,Runs like it should. Pops on everything. Solid
350,350,2023-12-31,1,80000,the United States,11900K,I have a Gigabyte z490 arorus motherboard. Its supports nvme pcie gen 4 and pcie 16x with 11th gen intel. I got this because the 10700k was bottlenecking my gpu. Swap was easy but as soon as the pc went under full load it blue screened. Would not boot until i put the 10700k back in. Immediately returned
351,351,2023-06-25,5,14500,India,12100F,"If you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives, this CPU is by no means a low end CPU dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle GPUs upto gtx3060 or rx6800. Just go for it and say no to ryzen in this price for gaming."
352,352,2022-11-16,5,14500,India,12100F,"This is one of the best cpu in budget if you only looking for gaming. For productivity it not worth buying then you should go for i5 12400f But for gaming and light cpu workload it work like butter smooth. I have teated some games in it , you can check it on my YT channel R tech studio."
353,353,2023-11-11,4,14500,India,12100F,Performance is good
354,354,2023-08-24,3,14500,India,12100F,"Product is good but by looking at packaging anyone can judge that it is used. While checking warranty found that out of 3 year warranty, 6 months is already passed."
355,355,2023-04-26,1,14500,India,12100F,Cpu stock cooler fan got broken with 1 blade in box was creating noise and virbration in cpu but processor was working fine so thought to replace but if replace it i dont know what i am gonna get with broken cpu chip so i replaced stock cooler with deepcool air cooler now it's working fine please don't buy critical pc parts from Amazon you may end up getting with broken parts worst packing
356,356,2023-06-20,1,14500,India,12100F,"The Processor is Good & Works Fine. But The Delivery was awful, one of the blades of the fan was broken. As i already had another dedicated cpu cooler, i didn't raise a return. I expected Better from Appario. Apart From this the Processor itself works fine."
357,357,2023-12-30,2,14500,Sweden,12100F,stood when I ordered it would come on January 5th since the day after I check and see that it is coming January 9
358,358,2024-01-27,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,"Very good, super recommend"
359,359,2023-11-23,5,14500,Germany,12100F,"Incredible speed and also saves energy for office applications!Faster than a few years older Core i7 processors, which at that time cost 700 euros.Also ideal for playing, all new games plays in Full HD."
360,360,2024-04-08,5,14500,France,12100F,"The Intel Core i3-12100F processor is ideal for Midrange gaming due to its excellent performance/price ratio.With its four hearts and eight threads, it offers good treatment power to perform modern games without problem.In addition, its high basic frequency and its DDR4 memory management up to 3200 MHz contribute to fluid performance in most games.By combining this processor with a mid -range graphics card, you can get a very satisfactory gaming experience without having to spend a fortune on the equipment."
361,361,2023-02-02,5,14500,Australia,12100F,"Works great out of the box, stock cooler is much better than previous generations, overall value is still the best in 2023"
362,362,2022-03-16,5,14500,Mexico,12100F,Pull the processor very well
363,363,2024-04-26,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,The seller is to be congratulated I loved
364,365,2024-03-26,5,14500,Italy,12100F,"The Intel Core i3-12100F processor is an interesting choice for those looking for solid performance without spending too much.Here are some details on the CPU: performance: the Core i3-12100F is a quad-core chip that can manage games if combined with a dedicated GPU.It is more suitable for activities such as surfing on the internet, work, study and video calls.Despite being an economic solution, it offers reliable performance.Energy efficiency: this processor is designed to offer a good balance between power and energy consumption.Even raising the limits, you will see modest but remarkable improvements in performance, without compromising energy efficiency affordable price: with a cost of about 100-110 euros, the i3-12100f represents a convenient option for those who want to play in Full HDwithout exhausting the budget.In summary, if you are looking for an economic but capable processor, the Intel Core i3-12100f could be the right choice."
365,366,2023-10-01,5,14500,Spain,12100F,"It goes like a shot, you can play the maximum resolution with the right graph without bottlenecks I have gone from an i5 of seventh generation and the difference is abysmal."
366,367,2024-04-09,5,14500,France,12100F,Super processor for both gaming and the rest!Coupled with an RX 6750XT it's at the top all the games runs thoroughly it has a super rate and does not heat too much with a good ventirad buy apart.Possibility of the OC in BCLK but not attempted I am already very satisfied.
367,368,2022-05-13,5,14500,Germany,12100F,"This processor offers excellent gaming performance for very little money - the 12100f even has a higher singlet thread power than an AMD Ryzen 3700X, and this is brutally good in view of the low price (see screenshot) - which is paired with a RTX 3050 or 6500 XTHas a top budget gaming system for the narrow thaler with a lot of power for 1080p gaming.I can only advise: access as long as it is still cheap!"
368,369,2024-04-26,5,14500,the United Kingdom,12100F,It's fantastic for its price range for a beginner build and how it performs well for a budget CPU.
369,370,2024-05-31,5,14500,Germany,12100F,Runs stable until now.
370,371,2023-10-11,5,14500,the United Kingdom,12100F,They perform better than even the 10th Gen i9. It’s absurd how well the current i3s perform when compared to high end chips from even two years ago.
371,372,2024-05-05,5,14500,Italy,12100F,"I came across the Intel Core i3-12100f processor and I was pleasantly surprised by his power and versatility.First of all, I must underline the fluidity of the performance.Thanks to its modern architecture and the four physical cores, the i3-12100f manages all daily activities without problems, from web navigation sessions to the most demanding game sessions.I noticed a marked improvement in performance compared to my old processor, especially in multthreading applications.One of the things I appreciated most was reliability.The i3-12100f proved to be stable even under intense workloads, without overheating and without compromising performance.This gave me the tranquility necessary to focus on my work without having to worry about sudden slowdowns or system crashes, I must also mention its energy efficiency."
372,373,2024-01-14,5,14500,France,12100F,"This processor offers an incredible price / performance ratio.It is as powerful as my old 11700kf in simple heart, and 20% slower only in multi-coeurs!I obtained 2236/10151 before (SC/MC) and now 2231/8153 on Geekbench 6. I was very surprised, in use I have hardly seen the difference by going from 11700kf/Z590 to 12100F/Z790, except for heavy multi-field work.At this price it is really impressive."
373,374,2022-04-03,5,14500,Spain,12100F,"Being i3, it is mea to other previous generations due to its high CPI, and in games it shows.Yield as a 10400, in games that ask for a lot of CPI, is above this.It has a low price for the performance it has but it has something bad: the plates are faces to the most shit*.Anyway, I recommend it.the truth.If Intel lower the price of the plates, they petize it."
374,375,2023-08-16,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,"Come processor and fan, excellent cost benefit"
375,376,2024-04-08,5,14500,Germany,12100F,Holds what is described
376,377,2023-05-28,5,14500,the United Kingdom,12100F,Great CPU for the price.
377,378,2022-07-25,5,14500,Spain,12100F,It is going well for the price you have
378,379,2024-01-15,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,"Find a supplier with short delivery time, very good."
379,380,2024-03-12,5,14500,France,12100F,"Mtn a little old, but well for debuting system"
380,381,2024-04-11,5,14500,Italy,12100F,"Intel has always offered high quality products and this i3 is a further demonstration!He does his work very well.Excellent quality/price ratio.In the package there is the dissatator with fan and the ""core i3"" sticker.As with all Intel ""F"" processors, need to be accompanied by a dedicated video card!"
381,382,2022-10-06,5,14500,France,12100F,"This 12th generation of Intel processors is definitely excellent!For 20 years, I had only bought AMD, but reading many tests that had highlighted the qualities of the 12100F, I therefore decided to take the plunge.At the start, I wanted a processor that is both powerful enough in the games, and which does not heat (and therefore that does not consume).Already because it was intended to be placed in an HTPC, having a little complicated airflow in essence, and then because I wanted to optimize the performance/energy ratio.I think it's mission accomplished.Reading movies, or while listening to music, the Intel processor and the graphics card (GTX 1660 Ti) do not each exceed 35 ° C, and climb respectively at 47 ° C and 62 ° C during the game sessions.I specify that the 12100F is cooled by a low-profile noctua NHL-12S ventirad, supported by an Arctic P12 fan, and is fixed in the socket by an adjustment frame, supposed to avoid deformations of the processor surface, of thermalright brand.In terms of power, this processor can be associated with any graphics card without limiting the potential of the latter, except perhaps those above the very powerful AMD RX 6900 XT and RTX 3080 TI.On the other hand, the Intel will fish a little without being ridiculous.Know that she has as much responding as a top of the range of 4 years ago.To summarize, with regard to the price, the 12100F is the best for a computer intended for versatile and economical use."
382,383,2024-03-10,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,Bom
383,384,2022-02-03,5,14500,Germany,12100F,"If the 4 kernels are enough + the hyperthreading, it is faster than a 6 penultimate generation coreer.Storage support is great and economical it is on top of that.Good 4 core, price a little high at the beginning, but that settles in.Semit -ligament cooler is absolutely sufficient and not heard.Everything fine"
384,385,2022-09-12,4,14500,Italy,12100F,"I like how the hearts of this processor beat, tested on several titles really keeps step in a shipped and elegant way as the VS I5 Gen 10 and 11 videos show, it is not bad for the small in Intel house, at the right price, whichThese days it is rare to find, it is recommended."
385,386,2022-04-12,4,14500,Spain,12100F,"This 12th Intel generation with Alder Lake works very well, I have mounted it with the ASUS B660 prime motherboard with Ballistix and Geforce 1050 memories (thinking of updating it then to 3060), and I have to say that it goes like a shot, fast loadingAnd consume little.Against: it brings a very poor cooling system (CPU Fan-Cooler) that I do not recommend, it sounds a lot and under load does not keep the processor less than 69 degrees Celsius of temperature (and it is not worth the paper), I solved it with aCooler Cooler Master Hyper H411r that fits perfect in LGA 1700."
386,387,2023-08-25,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,The best cost-effectiveness
387,388,2024-06-07,4,14500,France,12100F,Good product for gaming but I should have turned to his big brother the i5 12400F which is very close to the price level ....
388,389,2024-06-17,2,14500,Spain,12100F,"The box was broken through the corners and in bad conditions, I understand that it is from the cast company, but the product was fragile."
389,390,2022-03-03,3,14500,the United Kingdom,12100F,"As per the title, Intel's 12th gen lower tier stock cooler is pants. Don't waste your time installing it. Temps are high and it's constantly spinning up sounding like a light aircraft. Additionally if you are UK based and you buy from ""Amazon Global"" and need to return it for any reason, be prepared to have to pay the postage yourself and get reimbursed later. I think this is our fault (Brexit) but either way it's a massive faff"
390,391,2023-09-24,4,14500,Germany,12100F,"The only thing I didn't like is shipping.The packaging was open, dented/ damaged.But the CPU is great and nothing happened to the cooler."
391,392,2022-08-15,5,14500,Italy,12100F,"A truly excellent CPU.If obviously you are looking for an entrylevel product.From the reviews it has performances from a upper range of a few years ago, the CPU has 4 cores with HT so it manages 8th.I bought it for a second PC in a micro-ATX case with a single rear 92mm in extraction.As performance and reactivity, the CPU is really not bad navigation, reproduction.I did some cpuz -like beans and it goes a little more than my R5 1600 in Multi (6c/12T) and much more in st.Basically if you are looking for a CPU for navigation use, reproduction, light productivity, gaming (perhaps retrogaming on DX11 games) is the right product.If you do gaming on modern games (DX12) and with the goal of refresh supported (even minimal) then better a 12400 or higher (speaking of Intel).I did tests with Intelburntest and the CPU remains at 4.089GHz on all cores with 75 ° T in winter and 82 ° in July.I state that I use the Stock I said I only changed the thermal paste (Arctic MX4).The fan tends to turn a little fast to keep the T under control, however it is not very noisy on the contrary.Let's say that in my opinion I said is a little at the limit but it keeps the CPU at bay.If it were an i5 (six cores) I would recommend an aftermarket solution."
392,393,2022-06-20,4,14500,Spain,12100F,Great for all daily tasks and even for more intensive use like games.The Fan included could be quieter.
393,394,2023-08-06,5,14500,Germany,12100F,"Pretty cool in terms of temperature, powerful due to new architecture and reliable. Works more than a month in pair with an RTX 2060. No problems occurred during this time, I truly recommend."
394,395,2023-11-11,5,14500,France,12100F,"The packaging to make by Amazon leaves something to be desired for product of this type.However, the product works perfectly the performance is there!The Ventirad provided is enough to cool it I am not going up to more than 60 °.Very good processor for gaming"
395,396,2022-11-28,5,14500,Germany,12100F,"So I'm a streamer and honest, I had actually got a better CPU, but it was much better here, but why this CPU with the right graphics card is absolutely done by and for this price, just wow that is great"
396,397,2024-01-18,5,14500,Italy,12100F,"Great entry level processor, little energy but still good performance"
397,398,2023-10-02,5,14500,Brazil,12100F,"As expected,"
398,399,2024-02-06,5,14500,France,12100F,Perfect product to start a setup
399,400,2024-05-19,4,14500,France,12100F,GOOD
400,401,2024-04-29,5,14500,France,12100F,In line with comments 4 and more.No complaints.I recommend.
401,402,2024-03-07,5,14500,Italy,12100F,"This baby monster is crazy for the cost ... very little and chips to be afraid.I use it in any area, also Games, never to be signs of failure.In this price range there is no better CPU, I recommend it."
402,403,2024-03-14,5,14500,Italy,12100F,"Excellent in points of view, a perfect entry level for the world of gaming after a year of use did not give me any problem"
403,404,2024-02-08,5,14500,France,12100F,Hello the Intel i3 microprocessor works very well but it is not compatible with the motherboard azus z790-p This is the only reason for the return actually it has been the subject of a return but I am already shipped to you firstprocessor with the fan.Reimbursement of this will allow me to buy a compatible processor.Thank you.
404,405,2023-06-12,4,14500,France,12100F,"Excellent processor which is greater than an I7 of generation 8. effective in play, but less efficient on certain professional software, in particular the software dedicated to rendering.However, the Venti-Rad proposed in series is limited.Climb to over 3000 RPM at full load which causes a lot of noise.The processor reaches 80 degrees in the stress test phase, which is correct, but not optimum (there are 20 degrees of margin before the safety stop, however even the processor rarely reaches 60%).Investing in a fan-rad will not be a luxury.In case you still use the serial fan, remember to take thermal dough.Intel is quite stingy and the little that is placed on the base of the fan-rad is largely insufficient."
405,406,2024-03-01,5,14500,France,12100F,Very good CPU
406,407,2023-11-30,4,14500,Italy,12100F,"Very good processor, for 30 euros more honestly I would have taken i5 as it is slightly better in gaming.This does not mean that it is not suitable for playing because I am still very well"

414,415,2022-06-24,3,14500,France,12100F,"The processor does not even worry, apart from the fact that its Memoirs controller is limited to RAM 3200 Max.But the Ventirad is far too light for the game. Occt increases the temperature to 82 degrees in just 1min30, with 25 ambient degree, I stopped the test did not want to take it to a thermal throttling.Edit, I still take away a star for the Ventirad 24 degree ambient, on the games, it flirts with the 80 degrees during the full loads.And the unbearable noise of the fan which, in play, is direct very high in the towers to ""go down"", painfully, the temperature I order a real ventirad .... I finally took a Cooler Master, day and night.. Otherwise there is the snowman at 20/25th but no kit 1700 available on Amazon it seems."

448,449,2022-05-03,5,28500,India,12400,Performance is almost as good as 5600x and also consume less power than 5600x in gaming.  Stock cooler provided is not good enough though. See if it can keep good temperature for you else get good air cooler.
449,450,2024-06-19,5,28500,Japan,12400,No problem j
450,451,2022-04-28,5,28500,Singapore,12400,"I was initially only bought this due to it being the most affordable mid range CPU at 290 SGD for my new build, and was also considering similarly priced AMD Ryzen 5600X, but settled on this ultimately. I do not regret this at all. The performance is amazing and can run CPU-intensive games well along with my 3060ti. The stock cooler provided is also amazing and simple to install, but would have preferred if it came with metal mounting screws instead of cheap-feeling plastic push pins.  The price is well below other retail shops in Singapore including Sim Lim square. Although it is shipped from overseas, it is genuine and the packaging arrived sealed and undamaged. The shipping time also took less than a week.  The only problem was that motherboards with LGA 1700 sockets (that supports 12gen Intel processors) are currently much more expensive than LGA 1200 or AMD counterparts, so I had to settle with a non ideal mATX motherboard to stay within my budget."
451,452,2023-01-15,5,28500,Mexico,12400,"It is a very complete CPU, I am doing well with my RTX 3080 of 10GB, perfect for high -performance games and emulators, I love after just over 6 months of use, I have not had problems with any game or activity, it is perfect combinationAlso with a PCIE 4 Gen SSD, the machine flies.It has a good price ratio, it is also ready for update for DDR5 memories while you wait for you to lower if you can use DDR4 with a compatible and cheaper motherboard."
452,453,2022-09-30,1,28500,Germany,12400,"Unfortunately, the product packaging was open and glued back, which I felt suspicious.And in fact only the fan, but not the processor was included 😕😕"
453,454,2023-12-10,5,28500,Canada,12400,"The best value/price ratio for my needs. Fast, stable, compatible, good power consumption."
454,455,2024-05-01,5,28500,Canada,12400,"Worked well so far during my 4months of ownership! It still kinda sad that a similar CPU from 2018 is just 25-40% slower, which for most people is barely noticeable. That is 5y of advancement!"
455,456,2022-06-13,5,28500,Singapore,12400,"Intel i5-12400 maybe the best choice for gaming. no need efficient cores, the 6 performance cores with hyper-thread are powerful enough."
456,457,2024-03-13,5,28500,the United States,12400,So far it has been a good performance in gaming and productivity
457,458,2024-02-06,5,28500,Japan,12400,"It may be because it is not a game console, but the startup time is within 30 seconds.I was surprised.It is a speed that does not feel any problem at all."

459,460,2022-02-26,5,28500,the United States,12400,"Upgraded a 2600K pc with this CPU, B660 board and 32GB of 3600mhz ram. It feels incredibly snappy now. With GPUs now costing your firstborn child, it's nice that this upgrade boosted an aging gtx970 FPS by 5-15%. (@2560x1080) Gaming is also much smoother as low-FPS spikes are effectively non-existent now.  The included heatsink and fan is actually not as terrible as I was anticipating. It doesn't get all that loud and it looks halfway decent. It seems to keep the temps down to the mid 80s under stress testing (70 ambient) and mid 60s during actual gaming. I will replace it eventually but I'm not that concerned as it works fine. I did wipe off the pre-pasted thermal grease and added some MX-4 instead.  The internal HD 730 is nice to have as a backup. Anyone who doesn't need that should seek out the ""12400F"" model as it's the exact same chip with no internal GPU, and it should be $15-$25 cheaper.  As of this posting, it's hard to beat the value of this CPU (12400F/12400) for gaming."
460,461,2024-05-14,5,28500,Canada,12400,Great CPU for the price for a DIY NAS.

466,467,2022-10-31,5,28500,Japan,12400,"Cospa is good because the price is used in the game and the price is cheap.If you connect a monitor cable to the mother side and use it without inserting a cable into the grab, you can usually switch to onbo, and at a high load, and it can be saved."
467,468,2023-11-18,4,28500,Canada,12400,"This is pretty decent speed it is as fast or faster than my i7-11700 that runs windows server. Find the best price, use non economy mother board, that has bitten me in the past."

I will be testing the processor and I will comment on its performance."
473,474,2022-06-12,5,28500,Japan,12400,It may be very fast.This is enough because I don't play much.
474,475,2022-09-04,5,28500,Canada,12400,"I used this processor for my PC build and didn't have any issues. The thermal paste is already applied to the CPU fan, do don't stick you hand in it like I did."

477,478,2023-02-01,3,28500,Japan,12400,It is cheap on the outlet and purchased.It works without any problems.
478,479,2024-04-24,4,28500,the United States,12400,The CPU throttles for no reason during gameplay causing multiple crashes. I would not recommend this for gamming.

486,487,2024-02-05,5,28500,the United States,12400,Perfect 💯👌
487,488,2023-09-14,5,28500,the United States,12400,The i5-12400 is at a nice spot on the value/performance curve for a homelabber. Anything lower and you only get four cores. Anything higher and you have to deal with the P-core/E-core dichotomy. The included heatsink/fan combo isn't much to look at but it gets the job done.
488,489,2024-01-08,5,28500,Canada,12400,"I like it little CPU, 6 cores and better than Ryzen 5 3600"
489,490,2023-12-13,5,28500,the United States,12400,Good performance and quality/price
490,491,2023-05-13,5,28500,the United States,12400,I wasn't expecting much out of this CPU but it runs 3D CAD software better than my old i7-6700k and completely blows it out of the water with rendering and tool path generation. For the price it's dang near perfect. It's about 20% slower at generating tool paths than an i5-12600k but way faster than the previous generation CPUs. It's definitely a jump forward from the i5-11400 and about equivalent of an i5-11600k or a 10th gen i7
491,492,2023-10-15,5,28500,the United States,12400,"This processor works amazingly fast, hell so far I am able to run Armored core 6, and VR games just great."
492,493,2023-12-01,5,28500,the United States,12400,Very good processor.
493,494,2022-12-07,5,28500,the United States,12400,"You get more cores than an i3 based cpu. If you want to save a lot, you could go with a 12100f, but I think you get a lot of value with this cpu. You get the faster pcie lanes and more of them compared to the 10th and 11th gen cpus. And you can use a single fan low profile heatsink and fan with this and get around 75c temperatures during cpu stress tests. When the 13400 comes out though, this might not be worth it depending on the price it comes out with, but for now you get a great value and great performance."
494,495,2023-06-10,5,28500,the United States,12400,"The processor arrived well.It worked well and so far without problems.2 months have passed and it works well.For games for now it is well running with a 3070, I know there is more power in a 12600kf, but for the moment this 12400 is wonderful.It also includes integrated graphics."
495,496,2022-02-20,5,28500,the United States,12400,"Great 6 core chip for just about everything. Very good gaming performance. Will not bottleneck your GPU. Even if you have a 3080\3070 Ti, or a 6800\ 6800XT this CPU will deliver great performance. I have bought 2 so far and I even paired them with a budget ASRock B660 motherboard and still performed at highest speeds with 135W PL2. This CPU will definitely last a good 5 years since it has great IPC performance and is compatible with DDR5 RAM. All this for approx $180-220 is a bargain. If you don't need to overclock or don't want to spend a great deal of money this is the CPU for you. Will provide much better performance per dollar on a long term basis than the 12100-12300 4 cores CPUs."

512,513,2022-05-16,5,28500,the United States,12400,"I bought this processor in approximately $ 590,000 COP and has been very good in general, the performance is consistent with what you pay;I went for the integrated GPU version since the price difference was very little compared to the i5 12400F.The stock dissipator is sufficient in most cases, aesthetically more attractive compared to previous generations, however, I would recommend changing it for another dissipator (good options are found from 25usd to 30usd), to avoid high temperature peaks."
513,514,2022-09-20,5,28500,the United States,12400,For games it gives better performance than the current Ryzen 5000 processors and it is more economical to build an Intel PC with generation 12 than a PC with Ryzen Generation 5000. And thus I summarize a decent motherboard LGA 1700 as the B660M costs one $ 109.And if you want to buy an AM4 plate for Ryzen 5000 that is PCIEX 4.0 you must spend minimum more than $ 120.
514,515,2023-03-29,4,28500,the United States,12400,Assisted in solving the problems I had.
515,516,2023-08-03,3,28500,Canada,12400,"This is a decent value 12th gen CPU, but keep in mind when Intel said they would allow ECC on all 12th gen parts on a W680 board they specifically exclude the 12400. You have to go to something like a 12100 or 12500 for that functionality."
516,517,2023-04-11,3,28500,Canada,12400,Fast shipping as usual. The whole package seems fine but seems opened before since there were hair/dust on the paste. I had to clean off the stock paste. Lucky me I had a thermal paste on hand and really needed to use it or I would have returned it. Very disappointed on a 250$ purchase on a cpu. Not gonna buy something important again.

Stock cooler kept things nice and operable at 69-70C even by the end of the stress test. However, I did buy extra thermal paste and applied about 1ML across the full surface of the CPU chip itself, as others had recommended.  Value seems good, especially when you consider the fan should be able to keep up for most purposes."

For me, pairing it with RX 6600 gave me around 120 FPS in almost all games while playing on High Graphics. About the stock cooler, the stock cooler can definitely keep the heat away, i experienced less than 60° while gaming, although u can go for a better cooler if u prefer that, but the stock cooler will do its job. Overall 9.5/10 product."

553,554,2022-07-25,3,29999,India,12400F,Caution : Price 18k is Overprice now. Please buy it under 15k only otherwise check some other applications/sites for better price.
554,555,2022-04-03,4,29999,India,12400F,"The cpu is overall great for everything, it’ll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn’t. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don’t have an ac in your room, aio is the choice."
555,556,2022-07-14,5,29999,India,12400F,Best processor in this price range. Best performance all together.
556,557,2022-10-10,5,29999,India,12400F,"It is a good processor to build a low budget computer. In this processor, you have to install a separate graphic card. For the display, I would also say that installing a cooler or a liquid cooler is also very important because this processor heats up more."

558,559,2024-03-09,5,29999,Germany,12400F,I bought the processor for an H1 V2 from NZXT.This runs without problems on an Asus Strix B760i with 2x DDR5 6000MHz CL30.We recommend!
559,560,2024-01-17,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.  I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.  One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)  The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.  All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :)

575,577,2024-04-10,5,29999,Spain,12400F,"From the moment I installed this Intel processor on my computer, I was impressed by its exceptional performance.Despite its affordable price, this processor handles all my daily tasks with ease, from web navigation to text processing and video edition.What really highlights is its ability to handle multiple applications simultaneously without slowing down.In addition, its energy efficiency is remarkable, which means that it is not only good for my pocket, but also for the environment.In short, this Intel processor offers a perfect balance between price and performance.It is an excellent choice for anyone looking to update their system without spending a fortune.I recommend it a lot!"
576,578,2024-02-04,5,29999,Germany,12400F,"Great for the price, I only have one application open anyway, i.e. every game runs without problems."
577,579,2024-02-05,5,29999,Belgium,12400F,"For a first PC configuration, I set a budget of 1200 euros.For this type of configuration, the i5 12400F is frankly recommended.To see in use"
578,580,2024-04-29,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,Arrived in good condition and very fast
579,581,2024-05-09,5,29999,Italy,12400F,"It is the CPU of the moment for price-quality ratio, it always depends on the use you have to do, but anyway efficient also for the gaming obviously not extreme as it is a f and not a k ... perfect for build like mine with 16gbRAM DDR4, RTX 4060. Silent with standard heatsink"
580,582,2024-05-23,4,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,Would be useful to specify which boards it will work with as plug and play no longer exist.
581,583,2023-05-31,4,29999,Australia,12400F,It great if you're trying to make a mid-range PC but you could spent a little more and get the i5-12600k or the i5-13500
582,584,2023-09-11,5,29999,Germany,12400F,"Great processor!Delivery took place after 1 day.In the price range the best processor you can get to, in my opinion.Use it for 9 months and I am very satisfied.The enclosed cooler is also ""okay"".He cools the processor sufficiently but not necessarily quietly: D I would rather advise a good CPU cooler, don't cost much either"
583,585,2023-12-05,4,29999,Spain,12400F,"I caught it very cheap but I don't know if I made a good choice, with a 3060 of 12 GB, I still have problems when rendering videos, I think I would recommend an effort by the i7 12 generation, but this i5 I see it short"
584,586,2023-06-07,3,29999,Australia,12400F,What’s that noise? Oh it’s a broken cooler fan blade. Intel QA must have missed this one… shame
585,587,2024-01-17,4,29999,France,12400F,"The delivery went well, in time, but the cardboard box was slightly damaged on the corners.The processor itself is excellent, very good value for money.Very satisfied"
586,588,2023-08-29,4,29999,Belgium,12400F,"I love this cpu and its price tag. It can handle the newest games well and works quite well for graphic design applications. The only issue I have with this is your ram is locked to a maximum of 3200mhz. If you want to get it higher, consider a 12400KF"
587,589,2023-12-23,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,"Good single thread performance with 6 cores and 12 threads. Relatively low power too @65w so suitable for silent PC, at much lower price point than T coded CPUs (35w)."
588,590,2024-06-07,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,"It arrived very well packed, fast and everything as shown.But my PC is not yet complete so I can only test another time eventually.But no problem because this purchase is really reliable."
589,591,2024-01-17,4,29999,Italy,12400F,"This processor, without integrated video card in the possibility of overclocking, is an excellent choice for those looking for good performances for both working use and gaming.I bought it to assemble it on the PC on which I use most programs such as Ligthroom Ecce and I was very satisfied with it.I am also satisfied with its Gaming performance where it allows me to play in QHD, obviously with dedicated video card, in AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077. The processor is fast and reliable, I have not encountered any problems after almost a year or performancenor, after mounted a good after market dissipator, of temperatures.Speaking of temperatures, the only flaw, mounting the heatsink in stock temperatures, even with little load, stood at 70 degrees.You are forced to take an After market dissatrue.The price is very competitive compared to other processors of the same price range also today that the 14th generation has come out, if you have to make a budget configuration I would say that it is an excellent choice."
590,592,2023-12-08,5,29999,Belgium,12400F,Good processor!
591,593,2024-04-03,5,29999,Italy,12400F,"If you want to build an economic building, this is a good processor especially when it goes in first discount;I recommend replacing the Stock Digger with something more valid and silent, but if you are really restricted as a budget, the stock is also fine.He can still say his in 2024, especially if combined with a good video card (eg RX 6600) and a decent motherboard."
592,594,2024-05-31,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,In my opinion this is the best price you will find a 12 generation i5.It arrived very fast look that I live in an end of the world.
593,595,2023-06-02,1,29999,Australia,12400F,"Received this today, cpu was pre used and rattling around in the box in a sandwich bag. Thermal paste smeared around the cooler and cpu."
594,596,2024-06-08,5,29999,Germany,12400F,i used this cpu for my first ever pc build i pared it with an rtx 3050 6gb eagle edition its works together great
595,597,2024-04-27,5,29999,Spain,12400F,"A processor with very good performance, good quality, very correct temperatures and above all very good price."
596,598,2024-05-12,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,I really liked that they delivered it with care and it was on time. That was the most important part. so it was timely and they delivered it with less than a day. I like the quality but cant say it’s the best 7.5 / 10 I hope it came with a cooler for all this money tho cuz I aint keeping this if it didn’t I legit spent 100 quid on this over that. So hopefully it did
597,599,2024-04-15,5,29999,Italy,12400F,"The CPU is exactly as described and in the quality as expected from Intel, very good"
598,600,2024-04-22,5,29999,Spain,12400F,"The processor is the best in price performance, but if OC is also made by BClk it is insurmountable."

600,602,2024-04-19,4,29999,Germany,12400F,"I am absolutely enthusiastic about the CPU for the price there is nothing to complain about when it comes to gaming, I think the CPU is also aimed at such.First of all, there are only 2 minus points that for me personally are not so important.1 No IGPU without its own graphics card No picture 2 boxed cooler can be disposed of immediately (despite the specified 65watt) with boxed cooler over 80 degrees then to the plus points - power for degrees once € 119 you get a CPU with which you actual game above the60 fps brand can be banged.-Temparatures Even if the boxed cooler is not to be used, the CPU can also keep cooler with a normal air (€ 20 to 52 degrees, which is absolutely top.There is simply nothing to complain about for this price and every 1080p player up to 144hertz should enjoy the CPU.System ASUS H61 Gaming Matx Board Intel I5 12400F 2x16GB DDR4 Corsair memory Ghost Gainward 3060 12GB Aero Cool 550 Lux 2x500GB SSD Crucial You don't need it as long as you don't play in 4K"

602,604,2024-06-01,5,29999,France,12400F,Very good processor for the price
603,605,2023-11-25,1,29999,Belgium,12400F,"I ordered the CPU but when it arrived, a fan propeller was broken."
604,606,2024-06-17,5,29999,Germany,12400F,Is a mega good CPU does a job mega
605,607,2024-05-17,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,"If you think about setting up a new set up without spending a lot on a processor and yet have a good performance on your tasks and games, choose this.The cost benefit is excellent."
606,608,2024-04-27,5,29999,Spain,12400F,"I bought it 'as CPU for my son's first computer and it was a very good purchase, the games go great next to a graphic 3080."
607,609,2023-12-13,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,"Was going for a top end 1080p build and from all the reviews I’d read, the 12400F seemed like the best option. Easy to instal. Came with a cooling fan although I chose to use a bigger air cooler."
608,610,2022-10-21,1,29999,Australia,12400F,came in with broken fans on delivery
609,611,2024-04-19,5,29999,France,12400F,Super for games walking nickel (6800) on the other hand do not have a graphic part so do not forget to connect the screen to the graphics card and not on the motherboard otherwise black screen no detected signal.
610,612,2024-03-26,5,29999,Italy,12400F,"Tested a couple of weeks coupled with an RTX 3070 on some online games, I think it is a really excellent processor, it is descending price or with various offers is between 120 and 130 euros and at this price I don't think you can ask for better.The only drawback will be the new architecture, it will be the bios of the mothers, but the turbo core does not go to 4.4GHz on all cores simultaneously (as was the previous series 6xxx 7xxx or on the X99 or X299 platforms the famous option ""Enhanced Turbo Boost""It is not implemented here) but stops at 4 gigahertz .. I don't think it can change much in gaming, given several comparative videos also with i7 and i9 of the same series and the FPS are practically the same .. which leavesSeveral questions about the meaning or not to spend 3 times a lot to get little or nothing more, always remaining in the gaming field, in productivity surely processors with multiple Threads will make the difference."
611,613,2024-01-23,5,29999,Spain,12400F,"The need to buy a beautiful cheap processor and price quality.When I pay it, I came to luxury now, now I spend with good save and from 10 to go ahead."
612,614,2023-04-26,5,29999,the United Kingdom,12400F,"I am not a gamer but like to keep reasonably up to date and this intel cpu fits the bill for me. Its fast and works well with my motherboard. Reasonably priced for what it does, the cooler provided is ok for my needs as well but can get a bit noisy when the cpu remains at high % for some time. But overall very happy with this processor."
613,615,2024-02-02,5,29999,Brazil,12400F,"I use basically for flight simulator and answered perfectly, but I suggest using a Water Cooler.During the simulation it was reaching 72º with the original cooler.With Water Cooler 240 fell to 45th."

617,619,2024-05-08,5,29999,Spain,12400F,"Very happy to be a mid -range processor.I come from the Socket X99 (ASus non -Chinese plate) and well it was already difficult to modernize to my PC with the DDR5 and PCIE 5.0 so I opt for the socket 1700 and SPECPET Z790 and well I come from a 5820K also of 6 nuclei and 12hils like this processorBut in the benchmark that I have done, I really give it 45% more yield because 5820k had it at 4.40Ghz too if it were stock because it would be almost twice as much as powerful, as I had to buy almost all theComponents to modernize I throw through this since it is the most balanced processor for its price range when it recovers something will happen to another more powerful but with my 1080i it goes more than plenty."
618,620,2024-06-20,5,29999,France,12400F,Don't heat too much with a stable and powerful good ventirad

620,622,2024-05-31,5,41100,Japan,12600K,Play Video I was a very good processor...
621,623,2023-03-14,5,41100,Singapore,12600K,"12600K is faster comparing to my 3900X(same on 3200Mhz, 8GB x4), more snappy when switching charts. Intel graphics driver doesn't support multi monitors well in Windows 10, seems to be okay in Windows 11. it cannot remember monitor relative postion when resume from sleep. no other issues found."
622,624,2023-08-29,5,41100,Mexico,12600K,"I have used the processor already some time and I have not had problems with it, simply perfect"
623,625,2024-05-23,5,41100,Canada,12600K,Bought it to replace my old i7-6700k.  Is doing well and helping me reach better performance in games. Haven't had any issues with it so far.
624,626,2023-03-04,5,41100,Germany,12600K,CPU runs great
625,627,2024-05-23,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I’ve played on this for maybe a week or two? This thing is serious good, ofc purse coming from a guy that used to play on a i3 3rd gen, this is a night and day difference. This thing can support a TONNN of tabs and runs anything stupid fast, would super recommend."
626,628,2023-09-01,5,41100,the United Kingdom,12600K,"Got it for £174 from Amazon US, which is about £65 cheaper than buying one in the UK. Even if you compare it with a 13400, which has a similar performance running at base clock, it is still so much cheaper (£46). If I remember correctly, the cpu does not come with a warranty, which is probably fine as CPUs are known to be very durable. So make sure you test it when you receivie it so you know if it's faulty."

She mostly plays fortnight, minecraft, Hogwarts legacy etc and she plays on high settings while screen sharing in discord for the fam, and using OBS to record her gameplay no problem. We are very happy with the speed and temps we are getting from this i5. Glad we chose this affordable & reliable chip. Will probably upgrade in a few years when she’s playing more demanding games."

634,636,2023-08-27,3,41100,the United Kingdom,12600K,"Fast and effective processor. Was delivered by DPD who jammed this through the letterbox, crushing the packaging. It was unclear whether this was damaged until it was fitted. Fortunately it worked. This was purchased as part of a custom Games PC build. Other delivery companies were OK, Amazon left stuff on the doorstep as per usual. Royal Mail were excellent, seeing if anyone was in, or hiding the product and leaving a note of the location."
635,637,2023-09-15,5,41100,Japan,12600K,"Good quality product. I received messages about the location of my goods, so I always knew where it was and how long it would take to arrive. The packaging is good, performance is good."

638,640,2024-05-13,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"The 12600K CPU has been an outstanding upgrade from my previous setup, delivering a remarkable boost in performance. I've been particularly impressed by its cool operation, maintaining a stable 64 degrees even during rigorous stress tests and extended gaming sessions. The CPU comfortably reaches 5.1 GHz without any stability issues, and it seems there's still plenty of room for further overclocking if needed. If you're looking for a CPU that offers solid performance, low heat, and great value, the 12600K is a fantastic choice. Highly recommended for both gaming and general productivity!"
639,641,2024-03-24,5,41100,Canada,12600K,Very good CPU. Paired with 7800XT and everything runs cool. Dont forget to buy a cpu cooler with thermal paste and your good to go
640,642,2023-05-13,5,41100,Japan,12600K,not bad

642,644,2023-09-04,4,41100,Mexico,12600K,"In general it is a good product but its temperature management does not like it, on the one hand you can have a 50 ° C nucleus while another is at 34 ° C and another at 29 ° C and have ""rare"" jumps from equal 29 to 45 ° C;and that out of control a bit the management of the dissipator;This is using a new Gigabyte B760m DS3H Ax and liquid cooling Corsair Hydro H60, I come from using an AMD FX 8350 (which was heated a lot and that is why I get used to liquid cooling and with that FX always had temperatures in republic of about 25° C without rare jumps and with the same H60 and TDP of 125W), it should be noted that knowing the buckling problem that this series (LGA 1700) has installed from the beginning a thermalright pressure plate so that this problem does not happen;So far everything works well has never gone from 60 ° C but those temperature jumps in different parts of the processor still do me."

My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith. Again, I highly recommend this processor. Can't beat the performance at this price point with a stick."

I tested this CPU with a 3080, and 4080 and can say it gets the job done, but at 1080p I saw bottlenecking with both graphics cards."
660,662,2024-04-15,5,41100,the United States,12600K,This little beast is on par with new Ryzen 7700X and can handle all games 144 FPS if you pair it with a 4080. Hands down best CPU on 2022 and still rocking on 2023-2024
661,663,2024-04-24,5,41100,the United States,12600K,I have never had an issue with an intel processor in 30 years so I'm going to keep buying them.
662,664,2023-12-21,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"This processor with the rebuild of our desktop build has been very loyal and powerful. Mixed with a DeepCool AK620 and non overclocked I finally figure out the formula too achieve 4K ultra Gaming on most games that I play on a regular basis. I play numerous of strategy games but I do also play Grand Theft Auto (as an escape...) American truck simulator as of late and Roblox. The processing performance has been excellent. I hope that one day I can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages. Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process. I can go through a hundred tabs an hour and not have to worry about internal latency. It's good"
663,665,2024-04-13,5,41100,the United States,12600K,I've been with the product for a long time and so far not a fault
664,666,2024-04-18,5,41100,the United States,12600K,this article is very useful
665,667,2024-01-26,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"This processor is magnificent, a quality, moves the entire multitasking, its integrated graphics are magnificent, moves fornite in middle graphics all in high to 60-120 fps, it is not uncomfortable to play with some games, it endures a lot, I carry several tests ofStress, I took 5 days doing followed calculations sometimes with the processor at 100, I have not failed, excellent product, just remember that it comes without the stock dissipator and that I recommend you put a tower dissipator (a noctua, aerocool, aerocool, aerocool,Themaltake or Deepcool), it is more than enough, it has never risen from 65 degrees, a complete beauty"
666,668,2023-12-24,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"Bought for a Mini-ITX Build for my daughter when it was on sale for $149.99, felt like a nice value for Q4 2023. Didn't overclock this one, but could as it runs at just 48 degrees Celsius under load from Cinebench R23 with the (just-barely-fits-in-the-case) ThermalRight Peerless Assassin 120 SE ARBG. Side note: for anybody building a PC, that Peerless Assassin is the CPU air cooling champion at ~$40. This 12600k processor is more power hungry than some of it's AMD competitors, but having recently purchased an AMD 7800x3d for my own computer that's requiring a bit more work to optimize and get running properly, this 12600k was perfect. Intel stuff in my experience just tends to run good."
667,669,2024-04-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,good price
668,670,2023-12-17,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"Purchased for $150 for Cyber Monday 2023 and it's been excellent. In Cyberpunk 2077, with Ray Tracing on and a mix of ultra/high settings, I've reached 60-120 FPS (usually hovering between 70-90) with a Gigabyte Eagle 4060. I've hit 500+ FPS in League of Legends, and with V-Sync on, I've had no noticeable drop from 165 FPS. On sale, this is an excellent processor and an INCREDIBLE upgrade from my previous 9400f which was and still is a very capable processor. Temps are very stable with a Peerless Assassin cooler; I don't believe I've reached or exceeded 60 degrees Celsius. I haven't overclocked yet - if I even will, because current performance is excellent - but I've read that this processor overclocks a fair amount."
669,671,2024-04-03,5,41100,the United States,12600K,Works good and temps don’t get too high
670,672,2024-03-30,5,41100,the United States,12600K,Very good for a good price but there are better options for less money
671,673,2024-03-30,5,41100,the United States,12600K,Assembled my PC and it's working great. Just as expected.
672,674,2024-04-01,5,41100,the United States,12600K,It arrived in time and works great
673,675,2024-04-01,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"Great processor, equipment operating well and excellent"
674,676,2024-03-28,5,41100,the United States,12600K,I like it.
675,677,2024-02-29,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"System posted and my temps are staying low while overclocked. Everything has been stable so far, gaming and home use shouldn't be a problem at all 👍🏼"
676,678,2024-01-06,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I bought this the 12600k together with Arc A750 for new PC build. The mainboard I use is Asus Prime B660m-a wifi d4. I tested the CPU with cinebench, it was using 125 watts, the temperature was 70c with single tower cooler and no extra fans and also the mainboard was cool. I'm using this PC for video games and I like the 12600k so far."
677,679,2024-03-07,5,41100,Canada,12600K,"Not going to fan boi or tell you to pick on over the other. Current Ryzen 5 or I5 are going to give you what you need if your just looking for a solid but affordable gaming cpu. I went with the one that had the least investment required which just happened to be the i5 12600k. Already had a solid set of 4x8 cl14 3600mhz and 7000 series amd would have required ddr5, and set me back an additional 150$. Only reason I went intel over amd. Not ads, not influencers just boiled down to $"
678,680,2023-12-30,5,41100,Canada,12600K,This cpu is probably one of the best bangs for the buck at 200$ compared to others of similar quality I know cuz I bought a r5 7600 a year ago back for 300$ not the point this cpu replaced an i5 8400 I originally upgraded the gpu from a 1060 6gb to a 1660 super and only got a a few fps increase the reason being while games were starting it would bottom out at 10fps before returning to normal we were than at the time before cpu upgrade bottoming out at 13fps now after upgrading cpu I noticed the fps is now 27fps at its lowest while I understand most gamers would do anything for a single fps I just don't feel the end result is as great as I was hoping however my goal was reached by increasing the minimum fps also has overclocking capability but have not tried to play with any of that as of writing this nor am I comfortable with doing so
679,681,2024-02-05,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"A good product doesn't need an explanation. I have always trusted this store and every purchase is without any problems. This Intel core is really user-friendly, it won't make my computer overheat, and the storage space is also very sufficient"
680,682,2023-11-03,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I used this CPU in a recent build for a secondary computer that I will game on at a secondary residence. It performs very well even in demanding flight simulation applications. The onboard video is a nice feature to have if you remove the video GPU to swap it out , etc and you still have the ability to enter the UEFI/BIOS, Windows 10/11, etc. The K suffix denotes that the CPU can be slightly overclocked if you wish to do that. Good price on a great 12th gen Intel CPU. Works great when paired with both my Nvidia and AMD GPU's. No compatibility issues have arisen."
681,683,2024-01-27,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"When priced under $175, you simply cannot go wrong with this cpu. Not only is it a powerful chip with manageable thermals, its socket is also compatible with even the newest intel cpus should you choose to upgrade!"
682,684,2024-03-10,5,41100,the United States,12600K,Good temperatures and incredible performance 👌🏾👌🏾🌟
683,685,2024-02-05,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"This Intel core is really user-friendly. I didn't choose it wrong, it was the way I expected it to be. It added battery life to my computer and ran very smoothly."
684,686,2023-12-30,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"Intel i5 g12 processor with integrated graphics, yields excellent with its basic frequency without the need of the turbo mode.Heat when it is required too much, nothing that a good air cooling does not keep fresh.Excellent processing with its 10 real cores and 16 threads.Highly recommended for its cost - benefit ratio."
685,687,2023-12-25,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"Just built a new machine with an MSI board and did not want to spend too much. This CPU has decent performance and was over $100 less than the next generation up. My board will accept 12, 13 and 14 gen CPU's so maybe I will update in a few years."
686,688,2024-01-15,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"It works perfectly after installation and the temperature is constant. The socket is very tight and requires some force, so I thought the pin would be damaged or the edge would be crushed, but I finished anyway."
687,689,2024-02-29,5,41100,the United States,12600K,Excellent 100% functional product.
688,690,2023-12-23,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I'm loving my newly build, but still don't know what GPU to buy, so i'm stuck to iGPU... have not experiencing issue so far with this CPU, i'm using the iGPU and it lets me play Dota 2 on medium settings at 1440P which is awesome!"
689,691,2024-01-29,5,41100,the United States,12600K,Excellent price/performance over the budget 13 gen i5s. P cores push all core 4.9 no problem with even a budget dual tower air cooler.
690,692,2024-02-20,5,41100,the United States,12600K,Perfect for this price. Working good
691,693,2024-01-21,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"Have the CPU paired up with a 3060ti, 32gb of ram and 2 1tb m.2 ssd. Works amazing! Avg 145fps on most games"
692,694,2023-12-28,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I am just your average budget gamer. I upgraded from a i5-6500 and oh boy the difference in speed in gaming and productivity is night and day. Love this, bought it on Black Friday sale. Best buy."
693,695,2023-08-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"It fulfills everything that promises, I understand is a good investment, because I can use it for both gaming and work, excellent performance.For a normal person ita as I is super, because I have also used 12700 and they are very similar in terms of performance, despite the fact that 12700 has more nuclei and that its consumption is lower, I have felt more stability in 12600k.Note I do not do OC.I always use that in stock.I have it accompanied by RTX3080 and 64GB from RAM to 3600MHz and I have another one that I have already taken since this generation with 32GB of RAM at 4400MHz and they are a pass for me.One with refrigeration nzxt z53 and the other with noctua NHD15s and the temperatures are handled in both cases."
694,696,2023-10-27,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I built my first (budget) gaming rig this year and paired this CPU with an RTX 3060 and 64gb ddr4 ram - I'm running MSFS 2020 and averaging 40-45 fps on ultra settings, also playing Starfield and Jedi Survivor both on high graphics and they're smooth as butter on a 2k 32"" monitor. Using a deepcool cooler and a thermaltake case with good airflow, I haven't seen this CPU get above 60 degrees yet under high load. 100% happy with it."
695,697,2022-07-07,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I recently built an 15 12600k system and it has plenty of ups and downs. I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors. I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them. I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better. I would recommend the I5 12600k to anyone looking for a reasonably priced new chip that will allow their systems to handle most tasks with ease for the foreseeable future."
696,698,2023-10-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I purchased this CPU to build my wife a new desktop PC. She games some but primarily uses the machine to run adobe creative cloud suite. She is prone to multi tasking and can run the sims 4 with 1,000 mod files, Baldur's Gate 3 at medium settings, and watch her favorite streaming shows simultaneously. Currently her rig only has a used GTX 1060 GPU card and we are budgeting for a new 4060 but even with just the old 1060 from her old rig she can still multitask games and adobe apps to her heart's content."
697,699,2023-12-01,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"Wow what an incredible black Friday deal. Seriously, $153 is well worth it for the performance. I also purchased the 12700k for $211 which is yet another unbeatable deal offered this holiday season at amazon. If you managed to get your hands on either one of you made the right choice."
698,700,2023-11-12,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"No much to say. I caught a decent sale price for a new build. I could probably have saved $70 and gone i3, but I figured lets step up for the extra cores as I don't upgrade my desktop very often. There is not a whole lot of improvement from this gen 12 CPU vs the new gen 14 release. Just save the money."
699,701,2022-08-28,5,41100,the United States,12600K,"I’m so glad I decided to step up from the 12600T I was planning on using to the 12600K, which is the cheapest Intel CPU that has the efficiency cores. I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs.  I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.  The Core i5-12600K is roughly competitive in performance and price with the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X."
700,702,2023-07-23,5,50200,India,12700,Ultimate Performance
701,703,2023-12-21,5,50200,Spain,12700,Very good I recommend and deliver quickly.
702,704,2023-02-26,5,50200,Japan,12700,"I bought a PC for the first time in 10 years with the announcement of the Armored Core VI, so I purchased it, but since the fever is high, I use it in conjunction with the DeepCool AK620 CPU cooler, and attach a warped frame and use it as a gaming PC.Masu.The performance of STAR CITIZEN is not enough for a game, so you may replace it with a 13th generation CPU later.I was worried about i7-12700K, but I thought about the balance between performance and power consumption.(If the power consumption is large in winter due to the circumstances of the house, the breaker may fall ...) Others have also written, but it is better to purchase a CPU cooler and anti -preventive frame separately.If you can take measures such as fever and warpage, it is a product that is satisfactory for general game use, so I decided to ☆ 5."
703,705,2023-08-02,5,50200,the United Kingdom,12700,"Upgrade PC with motherboard and graphics card, new board did not facilitate my older processor. Bought this as I considered it fast enough for my needs and at a reasonable price. All works great."
704,706,2024-04-23,5,50200,Germany,12700,Works perfectly
705,707,2024-03-21,5,50200,Italy,12700,Very high performance CPU with very powerful incorporated graphic card

707,709,2022-04-07,5,50200,France,12700,"Super processor, very powerful, does not heat even with the Intel Ventil provided.Ordered Sunday received on Tuesday .... that happiness he wanders in all games."
708,710,2022-04-17,5,50200,Italy,12700,"Pass from a 12500 however excellent here we are still on another level.A speed of execution increased at least by 50 percent, for only 50 euros of difference I have far preferred this to a 12600k not affecting the overclocking speech.Combined with an MSI Coreliquid 240 V2 liquid, Idle temperatures are about 23 degrees and under stress do not reach 50 thanks to its very low TDP.Best value for money for what I'm concerned."
709,711,2024-03-07,4,50200,the United Kingdom,12700,Costs a lot and I do not recommend to anyone with a tight budget like £900 if you have a tight budget I suggest the ryzen 5 5600x but overall the cpu is great and it works perfectly fine with any game
710,712,2023-08-19,5,50200,Spain,12700,"New format, but great.The problem is Windows 11, I don't know when it will take off."
711,713,2022-12-22,4,50200,Japan,12700,"Intel has been since slot 1.I still think that the same price range is AMD.However, the CPU socket changed to AM5 and I searched for MB of AM4 in a hurry, but all of them are expensive.The highest MB of Gigabite was only when imported from the United States.Therefore, when searching for the company's MB, the Z690 MB for DDR4 was usually almost half price.Then, I think that it is about the same as the AMD 5900X.Since there are many writings such as ""CPU warp"", I purchased ""example of the example"" at the same time.I don't know if it's a good product unless I assemble it.I'm looking forward to."
712,714,2023-07-02,5,50200,Germany,12700,A CPU that I have been using for more than a year and will probably still do it for the next few years.Except for Windows (whatever?) She has never reached almost high utilization in games or compiling.
713,715,2023-10-05,5,50200,France,12700,Corresponds to the photo and the description superb very correct product packaging
714,716,2022-03-05,5,50200,Germany,12700,"What Intel delivers in the 12th processor generation is almost unbelievable.After AMD has mercilessly hung up the Intel competition in recent years, the situation has now changed completely.The i7-12700 (currently boxed approx. € 350) is a duel at eye level with the AMD R9-5900X (currently Boxed approx. € 460).For the technology enthusiasts briefly a few self-determined cinebench values ​​(R23): R9-5900X: Single-Core 1581 points / multi-core 22126 points i7-12700: Single-Core 1902 points / multi-core 22069 points run both systemsWith 32GB DDR4-3200 memory (CL16, 1.35V XMP profile), the CPUs without any overclocking.Chipset Intel: B660, chipset AMD: B550 => Clear purchase recommendation!"
715,717,2022-07-27,3,50200,the United Kingdom,12700,Before buying keep in mind that you might need a good cooler. I bought Noctua D15 which is very good at cooling and it costs me more than €100. So add more €100 while thinking to buy any intel high end processors.  The delivery was also late.
716,718,2022-06-19,4,50200,Spain,12700,"Almost perfect, just for the price."
717,719,2022-02-21,5,50200,France,12700,CPU almost as powerful as model K (between 2 and 5% difference) and easier to manage thermally because 2 times more sober in electricity consumption.
718,720,2022-03-31,5,50200,Japan,12700,"Recently, I used Ryzen CPUs, but I looked at benchmarks and changed the Intel CPU I have used so far into this.I think the feeling of use is a really good CPU.I was able to experience the goodness immediately just by the speed of Windows."

736,738,2022-09-27,5,50200,Italy,12700,"Recently purchased this processor of 12th gen I must say that it is a bomb, both as regards gaming and for the management of other programs.Unlike the i9 he warms half .. in short, I recommend."
737,739,2022-09-29,5,50200,Italy,12700,"Very versatile CPU you can do everything from work to gaming without problems (I recommend replacing the noisy stock dissatrator under stress, perhaps with a liquid system)"
738,740,2022-10-22,5,50200,Italy,12700,"Excellent and fast processor, tested and tried, for the moment it has not given me problems"
739,741,2022-11-15,5,50200,Italy,12700,"It pushes like a wild boar, but in certain scenarios he warms like an animal"
740,742,2022-08-10,5,50200,Italy,12700,Excellent high -end CPU x those who in addition to gaming want something more
741,743,2022-05-18,5,50200,Italy,12700,"Excellent processor, no noise.Arrived in an excellent packaging with air dissatator.Excellent value for money."
742,744,2022-06-05,3,50200,Italy,12700,"Can I know why the box has been opened and damaged?I bought it new, but it seems that they played football with him"
743,745,2022-06-28,5,60000,India,12700K,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!"
744,746,2022-03-29,5,60000,India,12700K,"I have paired this processor with Asus Prime Z690A motherboard and 32G 5200Mhz DDR5 ram. My usage is mostly for Adobe suite for 4K video rendering & photoediting (without dedicated eGPU) and ocassonal AAA title gaming like GTA5, Battlefield, Cpunk,etc. The processor works like a charm for rendering and Games upto 75Hz in 1080p ultra setting. Overall good processor for the price and more review to come in future edits."
745,747,2024-04-02,5,60000,Australia,12700K,"Working well, stable and can be overclock - with correct cooling setup. Good price too."

748,750,2024-04-10,5,60000,the United Kingdom,12700K,"So, being an AMD fanboy, I was not keen on getting this, but the c/t (cores to threads) kinda caught my eye. Running 12 cores, and 20 threads (4 e-cores i think) I thought, well, for the price, it should be okay? I was wrong... This cpu is a monster in my eyes. Running with 32GB of ram (ddr4) and matched with the RTX 4070 GPU being cooled by the Artic Liquid Freezer ii, there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max. I would recommend this piece of kit to anyone, starting out or continuing on with building computers for their ""high end"" gaming etc. I have not once seen this struggle."
749,751,2023-05-05,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,"At the time of buying it I had doubt about whether I would be very mistreated, since it is imported from Amazon USIt is at a lower price than the rest.I highly recommend it, especially for people like me who are assembling their first Gamer and Work PC and look for piece by piece."
750,752,2023-07-10,5,60000,Brazil,12700K,"It is very fast, but it gets a lot, it even uses 220W in stress test.Before you buy, try to know in the forums about this issue, no matter which cooler and thermal folder use, it will warm a lot.The only solution is to make a slight underVolt, or decrease the Loadline Calibration on BIOS.It reminded me of the i7-7700k that suffered from the same problem."
751,753,2024-06-17,5,60000,Japan,12700K,I was too high in high.
752,754,2024-01-18,5,60000,the United Kingdom,12700K,Excellent cpu and great value

766,768,2023-07-14,5,60000,the United Kingdom,12700K,Intel CPU is good
767,769,2023-07-26,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,It works perfectly.I notice the difference since I come from an eighth generation.And with a 4070 GPU I will have more experience about it.
768,770,2024-01-24,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that. AMD seems to be all the hype but I see why Intel won't be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip."
769,771,2023-08-19,5,60000,Australia,12700K,Good.......
770,772,2023-09-25,5,60000,France,12700K,Nothing to say and it does not heat (28c at rest) even without water cooling

776,778,2024-05-17,5,60000,the United States,12700K,Got it as an upgrade over my old 8700k and this is a huge upgrade. I do recommend installing a contact frame such as the thermalright for this CPU
777,779,2023-09-04,5,60000,Canada,12700K,"This is my first 1700 socket processor, so I can't really give it a proper speed review , however it was very simple to install , just be very very careful !!"
778,780,2023-03-17,5,60000,France,12700K,Arrived on time and the product is very efficient one of the best processor of the perfect moment for today's games which are often CPU-Bound!

780,782,2024-04-10,5,60000,the United States,12700K,I heard good things about this cpu and went for it. Budget friendly and a very good cpu!
781,783,2022-01-03,5,60000,Italy,12700K,"Finally a nice step forward by Intel.The processor is really good, park in consumption, powerful both in singles and in multi core and does not heat excessively.If you are looking at him here you will probably have already seen countless benchmarks on the web so useless to post them.Like all the components of a PC, it must be contextualized with respect to the use that a person has to do.Personally I recommend the purchase"
782,784,2022-10-06,5,60000,Mexico,12700K,No comment
783,785,2023-03-17,5,60000,Italy,12700K,Serious and recommended seller

It meets my expectations, I hesitated between the i5 12600k and this one, I do not regret my purchase.On the Amazon side, nothing to say ordered on Tuesday for a reception 48 hours later, Thursday."
785,787,2024-05-23,4,60000,Canada,12700K,Exactly what I needed
786,788,2024-02-03,5,60000,Canada,12700K,got it the next day as stated and was exactly as advertised. Yes would buy from again
787,789,2023-10-04,4,60000,Italy,12700K,"The processor is excellent, I use the PC for streaming and gaming and makes its duty without problems.But when I bought it, it had risen too much to price compared to other processors and quality-price.It works very well at the moment, in use for a month."
788,790,2022-08-16,4,60000,France,12700K,"It works well, with enough hearts and Lanes to have fun on virtual machines, but I who keep my computer consistently lit (inactive, but with open chrome and around thirty tabs, some of which are acting all by itself),I have increased my consumption compared to my previous 7700K.The turbo has just over 5GHz is funny, but it doubles the consumption and therefore the temperature.It works well but it gets severe when it activates the turbo, and if we try to correctly ventilate the slightest point gets along!"
789,791,2024-01-09,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"Just be sure to match up the chip correctly on the socket (one corner has a triangle cutout) Easy to install. Runs smooth and is not a power hog or a supernova in terms of heat. Even at load, it performs well.  Perfect for gaming, no issues in keeping up with GPU."
790,792,2022-06-22,5,60000,Italy,12700K,"Great quality product, planned the purchase for configuring a new PC.Very satisfied on purchase and delivery times"
791,793,2022-02-06,5,60000,France,12700K,"No problem when editing: I mounted a nightua NHU12A fan: when the proc works 100%, it remains under 80 ° C.In normal operation, the whole is silent.Be careful if the CM walks at the DDR5: it is twice the price of the DDR5.The GPU works well (video processing) while waiting for graphics cards to return at reasonable prices."
792,794,2024-03-03,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"A great performance, cheap enough for the performance it gives. I got this for 210$ on BF. Recommend!"
793,795,2024-02-06,5,60000,Canada,12700K,Good enough for this price range
794,796,2024-06-04,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"For me the best of the last three generations of Intel, a decent TDP, I have no temperature problems or any problem, I recommend it."
795,797,2024-05-13,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"runs Microsoft Flight simulator on multiple 32"" screens beautifully."
796,798,2024-04-09,5,60000,the United States,12700K,Perfect
797,799,2024-02-17,5,60000,the United States,12700K,Great product/Brand Intel i7 CPU. I have been using the Intel brand CPU's and have been using the i7 and the K series since they were introduced. This seems to handle video processing and CAD/CAM projects quite well. I have always had great luck with Intel brand processors and will continue using them. Pretty good value for the cost.
798,800,2023-12-04,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"Compared to the Coffee Lake generation I had been (willingly) stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap. Before buying I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a fan of Intel's newer way of handling cores, but the first thing I tried when I got it was emulating PS3 games and right off the bat I saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled.  The older CPUs from the 8th, 9th, and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if you're on a budget maybe look on the used market for those. But if you really need something powerful this is a good option."
799,801,2023-08-05,4,60000,the United States,12700K,"This item has been with me for a very short time.  So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.  I hope you find this review helpful."
800,802,2024-03-15,5,60000,the United States,12700K,Huge upgrade from 8th gen i5! paired it with the ASRock Z690 and 32g DDR4
801,803,2023-12-02,4,60000,the United States,12700K,"The morning after building and setting up windows, drivers, etc. The PC had blue screened because of temperatures, and after a reset and entering the BIOS I saw that the temperature was 89 degrees celsius. Thankfully, after some trial and error I was able to undervolt it and not have my CPU die. I'd suggest anyone who looks into getting an intel CPU to undervolt it!"
802,804,2024-01-12,4,60000,Canada,12700K,"the one i bought one year ago had instability. didn't know it was the CPU until it really started acting up. had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the CPU. When i reached out to Intel, they Informed me about a policy about ''tray'' processor and ''boxed'' processor. basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they don't cover warranty. As for Boxed processor, they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more. Fortunatly, the one i got was a boxed one, but still Intel told me i had a ''tray'' processor. i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a ''box'' processor. It was a bit unnerving, but at the en, they offered me the warranty and i'm supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them."
803,805,2024-03-19,5,60000,the United States,12700K,Used at work.
804,806,2023-12-10,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"At this time in the product life cycle, the 12th gen CPU is about half the cost of the 14th gen CPU. It is more than fast enough for everything I do. My major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have TPM 2.0. The CPU was easy to install, it is running between 36-37 degrees Celsius (though I admit I am not stressing it). I am very happy with my purchase."
805,807,2024-02-05,5,60000,the United States,12700K,I received the product with the promptness of the case.I arrive sealed and in a box with another product.The operation is good and not usually heated with a good air cooling system.
806,808,2024-02-25,5,60000,the United States,12700K,This appears to be the best option for intel at this price range. Works as advertised.
807,809,2024-01-29,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"I bought it when I was special, and there was no problem in use, and the money was worth it.I PURCHASED It at a Special Price, and I haven't enCountered any issues in terms of usage. It offers great value for the money."
808,810,2024-02-02,5,60000,the United States,12700K,It's a top-of-the-line CPU that will last for a long time. There's nothing to dislike about it. it replaced a 12 year 3770K!
809,811,2024-01-16,5,60000,the United States,12700K,If you're looking for an Intel cpu I would recommend this even though it is a couple years old now I belive its still the best intel cpu for gaming
810,812,2024-02-25,5,60000,the United States,12700K,Play video and see how it behaves when you make my assembly
811,813,2024-01-24,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"Went from a 9400f to this was a big different on gaming, i finally get the fully potencial of my gpu"
812,814,2024-03-02,5,60000,the United States,12700K,Great
813,815,2024-02-19,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"Great cpu, would buy again."
814,816,2023-12-01,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"Wow what an incredible black Friday deal. Seriously, $211 is well worth it for the performance. I also purchased the 12600k for $153 which is another unbeatable deal offered this year at amazon. If you managed to get your hands on either one of you made the right choice."
815,817,2024-01-18,5,60000,the United States,12700K,This is a second purchase of core i7 12700. It works very well as expected.
816,818,2023-11-30,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"for my limited budget, I bought it, While the 12700K isn't the top of the line, at least for me, it was more affordable and very performant. I've had good success overclocking it and actually undervolting it to reduce temperatures!"
817,819,2023-12-28,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"I've installed a 10th gen 2x, 12th gen, and a 13th gen on my family's pc's. I've never had a problem."
818,820,2023-08-05,4,60000,Canada,12700K,"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable."
819,821,2024-01-05,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"Great CPU for multitasking, I don't know too much about CPU but this is great!"
820,822,2023-07-21,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"So far so good, but then that's what I said about the last one... I'll check back in a year on this and hope it outlasts my prior CPU.  As for the last one... it's Intel dropping the ball with their QC it seems. Had an IMC function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed. Couldn't run any XMP profiles, and swapping the processor solved it (not a Mobo issue).  Just watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen, and return it if *anything* seems even *remotely* off."
821,823,2023-07-25,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"The heart of my PC build and wanted to have the ""K"" version with the Integrated Graphics... even though I was going to have a GPU anyways, it's a good backup if the GPU fails.  Can't do a Pro and Con here as there is nothing much to report. It plays every game without bottlenecking my RTX 3070 and was a breeze to install (there is literally one way to install it. <You'd have to intentionally or forcibly install it wrong). Also, it runs surprisingly cool and doesn't act like an easy-bake oven in my Motherboard."
822,824,2023-07-16,4,60000,the United States,12700K,"Not much to say about this cpu. It's Intel, and these are immortal. Still have the 3770K I got like 10 years ago, and an Extreme I got even earlier than that.  So the main motive here is to let Amazon know that I HAVE received the item, but I don't know how to let them know so they can change the ""package left at mail"" to ""Already received""..."
823,825,2023-11-22,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"I got the CPU on sale and I would say the performance is great, my application is running smoothly and does not come into any problem for a year now."
824,826,2023-11-16,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"this thing is a workhorse! ive got mine clocked to 5.0GHz and it runs like a dream, keep in mind this unit will require a water pump air coolers are not enough!"
825,827,2023-06-26,4,60000,the United States,12700K,"Bought this K to have graphics backup. The CPU is great the graphics not so much. Still I do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my PC, but only for the purpose of having temporary backup when needed. So for that purpose it works. The cost vs the KF is fairly negligible so for its primary purpose it is a very good CPU."
826,828,2023-01-02,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.  If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows: 1. i9-13900k 2. i7-13700k 3. i9-12900k 4. i5-13600k 5. i7-12700k  This chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.  In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)"
827,829,2023-09-22,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"Bought this for a new personal PC. My last was an i7 4790K build that got totaled out (crushed) during shipping. After building a new one on a z790i platform, the performance gain was stunning, completely night and day! I cannot say enough about this CPU, and would totally recommend this product!!"
828,830,2022-02-15,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.  Some things to consider before purchasing: 1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4. 2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead. 3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.  Good luck!"
829,831,2022-08-04,5,60000,the United States,12700K,"I had been planning to hold off for Raptor Lake, but my Z370 mobo died, and I decided to go ahead and get an Alder Lake i7. So far it's impressive. It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months. 3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be, from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect. The days of getting another 800Mhz - 1 Ghz+ over stock clocks out of a CPU are gone it seems."

838,840,2023-04-28,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"Play Video I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.  Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.  The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.  The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers."

841,843,2023-10-31,5,99999,Canada,12900K,This CPU has 24 threads and 16 cores (8E cores and 8P cores) which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issues  Doesn't cause a CPU and GPU bottleneck as I only get about 45% GPU usage and stay under 10% load in most AAA titles like Destiny or Call of Duty.  CinebenchR23 Benchmarks  Using CINEBENCH R23 I got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70 % of top performing CPU score of 43640.  Using Geek Bench 6 test  I got a Single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83 % of top performing CPU score of 3097 And a multi-core score of 12821 which is roughly 56 % of top performing CPU score of 21742
842,844,2022-01-15,5,99999,Italy,12900K,Finally Intel remembered that it produces processors.Product undoubtedly at the top both as a price and as performance.On 12900 and Comuqnue a niche processor dedicated to the most extreme build or to those who really need great performances.Weaknesses consumption and temperatures.Another painful note lack of compatible or serious problems in finding the components to complete the pc laxing.I highly recommend for the i 9 and the most estro phase a high -end or liquid air cooling.

847,849,2023-05-11,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7."

Even on Escape From Tarkov at max settings 4k 140+ fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0-1 percent, I don't know if it's my computer reading an error but I use a few apps to check including the task manager tab. I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail, Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage. My GPU barely works as I have a 3090 TI, my GPU is usually at USAGE 40-50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool, so I don't think anything is bottle necking.  My old computer has an I5 and I have a laptop with an I7 and when I am gaming they are usually at 90+ percent usage. Even my friend with the AMD 5800x3D was getting at least 30+percent usage for AAA games. This is the first Computer I've built where I'm actually not even worried about the CPU for how cool it runs.

866,868,2023-01-02,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings. After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions. For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed. So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well. Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer. If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling."

The temps were at 89 to 92°C after the deep cool AIO under stress, test and bench testing the temp stay under 60°C , other than that I game hard on it and stream and the CPU usage never goes past 30%.

This can handle anything I throw at it, without issue (gaming wise) and never goes above 50/55C (not overclocked and cooled with 240MM AIO from Corsair) Idles around 32/33C Very responsive with plenty of clearance if I ever want to OC this guy. Heat was a concern after reading reviews and only having a 240MM radiator (sitting over a 4060Ti), but no issues - heat or performance) at all.  Great time to buy with new gen just arriving recently."
871,873,2022-02-21,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load)."

The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming.

As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.  For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of.

The raptor lake, and forthcoming, will of course be better, but if you need the best Alder Lake CPU and can find a decent deal, it won't let you down. I'm able to cool it efficiently with a Noctua N-14 (single stack, single fan setup) and it works great."
881,883,2023-10-13,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Bought on sale. My rig placed in the 97 percentile. The pc is overclocked. The processor is running cool and stable. No issues yet. Would recommend
882,884,2023-12-07,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Well packed and new.
883,885,2023-09-25,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"This CPU is top quality, it is easy to install and works great for gaming, it stays cool and I have had no problems with it."
884,886,2023-10-05,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"I bought it with price lower than I7-13700, which was very good choice and happy with the decision"
885,887,2023-09-15,5,99999,the United States,12900K,I was going to go for the 13900k but I took this one for half of the price and have to tell u love it thank you
886,888,2023-07-09,5,99999,the United States,12900K,It's been less then 24hrs since I upgraded from an i7-8700 and could instantly tell a difference in performance. Haven't had the need to overclock since it handles streaming on twitch/kick with obs while playing games on the same PC very nicely at stock settings.
887,889,2022-07-21,4,99999,the United States,12900K,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250."
888,890,2023-04-29,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"many cores, able to run multiple virtual machines with unnoticeable slowdown to other functions. Stays at 1-3% when playing games paired with a 3070. May upgrade to 13th gen later, but i really can't complain in terms of performance. Only have a dualfan/dual heatsink cpu cooler and it stays below 60 celsius at all times. Rests at about 30."
889,891,2023-10-24,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Fast shipping and great product
890,892,2023-04-19,5,99999,the United States,12900K,This CPU is power hungry under load but in games the CPU is fast. This also works fine for workstation workloads but this shines in gaming for sure. Also if you have the cooling this CPU can be clocked even higher for better performance. But for this you will need a decent CPU cooler.
891,893,2021-12-16,1,99999,the United States,12900K,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.  Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.  If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.  My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.  Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.  Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.  Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.  Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen."
892,894,2023-09-27,5,99999,the United States,12900K,great price easy to install
893,895,2022-08-22,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"Now has a thin film over it. Don’t know how it receives electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard, probably similar to wireless charging, but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while handling the CPU during the build. After all CPU is the most or second mot expensive component in a PC build.  Other than that, the increase in core count and speed, couple with gen 4 SSD and RTX 3090 ti, everything else is just slow"
894,896,2022-10-19,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"Received at least a week earlier than the scheduled assessment for delivery. Not installed yet but if you look at video reviews I'm sure you know this processor is going to preform when you need it as a creator. At the moment I'm still using a 2010 year, i7 that endured the test of time in a properly built computer. Now it's time for the i9 12900K LGA1700 creator build computer to handle photography & video production in 2022."
895,897,2023-10-03,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Good
896,898,2023-05-30,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"This unit is powerful for all of your needs. Just remember this thing runs really hot!!! Make sure you use a good cooling system. Otherwise, you will have thermal throttling issues."
897,899,2023-10-16,3,99999,the United States,12900K,I bought this thinking it came with the whole case and everything but it came in a cheap little box that was half crushed.
898,900,2023-03-23,5,99999,the United States,12900K,This is the fastest processor I've ever owned and with it I upgraded my entire pc. Even though I purchased last years model it's still extremely fast and works well.. Make sure you pair this with a good motherboard otherwise it can run pretty hot.
899,901,2023-07-10,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Could is great but. Boy does she put off some heat. Feels like a furnace under my desk
900,902,2023-03-25,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"This cpu is killer and can literally handle any game you throw at it on max settings, and the same can be said for most workload programs. However I bought it back in early 2022, when it was still way overpriced for what it is now"
901,903,2023-07-18,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"Really fast for gaming, excellent speeds. Intel Driver software is nice too."
902,904,2023-08-24,5,99999,the United States,12900K,It arrived excellent and without problems.100% recommended
903,905,2023-09-10,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Great Processor
904,906,2022-09-12,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Awesome Cpu blazzzing fast !!!!!! for gaming and other tasks . i see that the temps for this cpu work up into the 70's and even higher 80 + my recommendation is to undervote your cpu if your just gaming that will lower temps. With good thermal paste Kingpin cooling KPX and a water cooler im getting 55-58c in gaming hope it helps.
905,907,2023-06-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Not sure if I bought the best in terms of value and performance!
906,908,2023-08-15,5,99999,the United States,12900K,supper fast works just grate
907,909,2023-08-09,5,99999,the United States,12900K,Thanks I get fast and good performance
908,910,2023-06-01,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"Powerful, speed, great performance ... really a great wonder what this processor does."
909,911,2023-02-27,5,99999,the United States,12900K,I found this on sale for $350. A 12th gen i9 for a comparable price to an i7 I mean the review writes itself couldn’t have been more excited to get such a great cpu for such a competitive price.
910,912,2022-07-21,5,99999,the United States,12900K,The processor is amazing. Upgraded from an Intel 8700k. Paired it with 6400 mhz DDR5 memory on a AsRock z690 Taichi motherboard and my Nvidia EVGA 3080Ti and I'm consistently in the top 5% of benchmarks world-wide with barely any tweeks except selecting the XMP profile in my bios. Blows away anything currently AMD is offering in the same price range.
911,913,2022-12-16,4,99999,the United States,12900K,"Very excited to get up and running, came in OG box sealed. Took a long time to get but very pleased"
912,914,2022-10-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"There's nothing more to say, if you only want gaming get an i7, unless you're into emulation that's the only instance where you'll get an actual edge It runs pretttty hot as it takes over 250 watts if it can, in my case over 270 so keep that in mind"
913,915,2022-06-11,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"I had been working with Xeon for 10 years, and I have to clarify that they have been excellent and durable processors, but I needed to update a processor that was faster and I have taken the rightner with this i9.Work in design in general, video edition, animation and 3D, where there is a benefit thanks to its power, everything moves as butter."
914,916,2023-04-01,5,99999,the United States,12900K,This was a huge upgrade to my system for good price. Im back into the modern pc world. Win 11 runs great
915,917,2022-04-06,4,99999,the United States,12900K,"The processor is excellent and its performance does not let it desire.If you doubt one of the best processors today.However, at maximum load it is difficult to refrigerate and has very high energy consumption, but in the rest of the applications consumption is usually very low and maintains good temperatures"
916,918,2022-09-07,5,99999,the United States,12900K,This thing is truly impressive. It also comes in a very shiny golden container. It makes you happy the moment you open the package. As far as I have researched this is the absolute best and most powerful processor on the market as or 9/6/2022. I definitely recommend.
917,919,2022-02-18,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"I love this processor, it can handle anything I throw at it. The only thing I was concerned with, is that I bought it 'new', but the stickers were peeled off the Intel 12900k box, so I am not sure what was up with that, it looked like it still had the safety seal on it though, but at least it works."
918,920,2022-11-26,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"It will handle all your multitasking needs with ease, even while gaming. Only con I can think of is that it does run very hot so you'll need a high end cooler to get the best performance"
919,921,2022-09-09,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"I'm very satisfied with this processor, I've used Intel for many years now and I've never had any problems with them. Looking back when I first started computer gaming, I was gaming on a 386 dx66 that I bought from Mongomery Wards...lol.."
920,922,2022-12-21,5,99999,the United States,12900K,I absolutely love the gold packaging this came in. The product works as intended and it's worth every penny considering how much cheaper it is than the MSRP.
921,923,2022-11-19,5,99999,the United States,12900K,"I Did install it on ASUS ROG Maximus Z690 Formula(WiFi 6E)LGA1700, the motherboard is already high price unworthy money & CPU is overpriced, but it has great performance overall, Thanks to the seller is trusted!"

929,931,2024-04-23,5,28999,the United States,13400F,"I'm working on upgrading my current build and this was just the thing I needed. So many games run so smoothly with this and it's hard to beat. It hasn't thermal throttled, and I'm sure that's because the stock cooler does the job just fine. It works perfect with a 650 watt 80+ bronze PSU. Do recommend for any mid to high range builds."

931,933,2023-09-04,1,52743,Belgium,13500,A room was missing in the box
932,934,2024-04-22,5,28999,Canada,13400F,"Hello,  So I bought this processor to replace my ryzen 7 2700x that finally decided to die on me. I have had the ryzen since launch.  I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.  With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.  My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender. Or in zbrush, maya, 3ds max, or substance painter."
933,935,2023-10-17,5,52743,Spain,13500,"I bought the i5 13500 due to the good comments since for the video edition I would be phenomenal.I have installed it on an ASUS Rog Strig B660 F Wifi plate, two NVME M2, (Kinston and Crucial), Corsair Memory of 6000 MH.The plate, after the cold update of the BIOS accepted the G3 processor, the memora, after activating the BIOS tab, works at 6000 mh without problem.As I said, I bought it for video edition, I have been doing a test with the integrated graph, (I have not yet placed the dedicated one).I have been a pleasant surprise, because with this configuration without integrated graphics, I created a 15 -minute video, without tracing or anything, (it was a test), the raw video, after 3 or 4 minutes, video finished when with myOld I7 took half an hour to 45 minutes, I am talking about a 1920x1080 resolution.I mean, you can with it.Maybe it also has something to do with the editing program that is not of the pointers that everyone names, but that is fantastic and does the same.I've been using the Magix Edition program for a long time, if my old PC could, this one owed much more, as it has been, since the program itself does not require so many resources.For now very happy.I have it with the dissipator that everyone hates, (the one of origin) that comes next to the processor.When you edit every pill I will see if it is heated or not, for the moment not.I simply want to give a pull of ear to whom it corresponds since the box arrived despised and for criticizing it, Amazón has not published two reviews prior to the assembly of the same.I forgot, I have mounted the processor with the suggestion plate that is sold apart and ensures the four -screw processor to prevent double.I recommend it 100% since it is to enjoy with this configuration."
934,936,2024-04-03,5,28999,Japan,13400F,It works stably.
935,937,2023-06-21,5,28999,Mexico,13400F,"I bought it to play video games and I am quite satisfied, I run all the games in ultra without problems at 60fps stable (I have a 3060ti) it is definitely worth having the 13th generation once so that the useful life of the PC is a bitlonger"
936,938,2024-03-20,5,52743,the United States,13500,This CPU was a no-brainer for a budget Gaming PC. Works well and was super easy to install in my Asrock z690 RS.

938,940,2023-08-30,5,20250,Canada,13100,For the price
939,941,2024-05-25,5,28999,the United States,13400F,"Wow this thing is fast. Intel has done an amazing job with the 13th gen. I'm using it on my dev machine and the vs code / node.js / react environment starts up lightning fast. And with 6+4 cores, there's plenty of room left for background tasks (docker containers!). And I'm still amazed at how affordable such a powerhouse processor is. I literally don't need to go i7 or i9. Love the competition AMD and Intel are still having and am happy to have a processor split household :)"
940,942,2024-03-08,5,52743,Japan,13500,"Transfer from 4690K.The cooler uses AK500.It is the best because it can maintain 4GHz even with a full load.There is also a improvement in the undercarriage of memory and SSD, but the experience has become quite crisp.Even though it is in the late 30,000 yen range, this is a middle class is a great era.I think it's still enough to buy, but in the future there is a flow that incorporates the NPU circuit, so if you anticipate that the local processing AI -based app will be common, the NPU will enter the desktop several generations later.I think that if you buy a model of, you can use it for a long time."
941,943,2023-09-13,5,28999,the United Kingdom,13400F,Great performance on a budget. Great core for a 1080p/2K gaming machine. Easy to install and no issues with operation.

943,945,2024-05-21,5,28999,Canada,13400F,Paired it with a rtx 3070 and handles everything very well. 40% utilization with full load of GPU. Also great for productivity with 10 cpu cores.
944,946,2023-09-14,5,20250,the United States,13100,"I build PCs for clients daily. The core i3-13100 is absolutely perfect. 6 core 12 thread, nothing can beat it for the money. And the client is very happy with its performance. Can run many different programs at once.  The core i3 has changed alot over the years. Used to be dual core, with HT, then quad core not HT, now 6 core 12 thread. Much better value. Maybe for the 14th gen core i3 they could include 6 P-cores, 2 E-cores, being the same 12 thread CPU,"
945,947,2023-09-15,5,52743,France,13500,Good product
946,948,2024-04-11,4,52743,Japan,13500,It was very useful to explain how to attach to the motherboard with illustrations.
947,949,2024-05-02,5,28999,the United States,13400F,This CPU is more than enough for any mid-low end PC build and will play well at any game (including AAA games) In fact I think you can definitely save money and go for the 12400f in terms of bang for buck. Loving this CPU and fixed my bottleneck
948,950,2023-05-13,5,20250,the United States,13100,"If you need more processor, buy more processor. However, most web surfer and video viewers will never notice this is a budget CPU. Modern tech makes this little guys speedy as heck. It runs games just fine as long as your expectations are super high end 4K gaming at a zillion FPS. Check youtube for videos. Great little chip."
949,951,2024-06-03,4,28999,Japan,13400F,I am very happy to be able to buy what I wanted at a low price.The product is also used and can be used without any problems.
950,952,2024-03-30,5,28999,Canada,13400F,This thing is still rated in the top for gaming processors and has served me well over the past few months. Upgrading my video card now to take advantage of this better as it's creating a bottle neck. Handles VR games like a charm and doesn't struggle with anything I've thrown at it!
951,953,2023-10-27,5,52743,Canada,13500,"Plenty fast enough for me, I do some gaming (War Thunder, Cities Skylines, Company of Heroes) and some Stable Diffusion AI artwork and this handles everything.  The integrated cooler is small and handles the heat fine, without having to worry about paying for elaborate cooling solutions."

954,956,2024-03-30,5,28999,Canada,13400F,Bought this to replace a burned out chip on my old motherboard. Install was easy (so long as you know what you are doing) and only took a few minutes to get my computer up and running again.
955,957,2023-07-13,4,20250,the United States,13100,"The 13100 isn't the powerhouse that the 13900k is, but it works well for day to day task where a more powerful processor isn't required."
956,958,2023-08-05,5,52743,Japan,13500,"I was surprised to see 60fps in the CPU encoding of 1080p video in Aviutl X265.Compared to other PCs with the same encoding settings ... Core 2 QUAD Q8200 is 5fps (SSE4 era without AVX command) Celeon N4100 is 5fps (4 core Atom ≒ Core 2 Quad law) Ryzen 5 3500U is 7fps(Zen+AVX256 is internally a 128 -bit processing equivalent to SSE4) Ryzen 5 Pro 3400GE is 17fps (I guess it is the same as Sandy Bridge) Core i7 4770 is 20fps (faster than Zen+ So a sense of outdatedRyzne 5 5500U is 25fps (ZEN2, 6 cores of model number fraud, but only 2.5GHz) Core i5 1135G7 is 30fps (AVX512 compatible with 4 cores.5750GE is captured for those who do not know SSE/AVX (Zen3 is not AVX512 and is slow for 8 cores).SSE/AVX (so -called SIMD instruction) is a technology in which the CPU operator (recently 256 to 512 bits) is subdivided according to the variable type (8-64bit), and the calculation is parallel.AVX256 calculates 8 -bit variables in 32 parallel, but AVX512 can calculate in 64 parallel.The recent performance of the CPU is almost determined by the speed of the AVX instruction.In particular, the speed of the video encoding and generated AI appears in the superiority of the AVX instruction.Intel has a fast AVX order since Haswell Refresh (4th generation), and is strong in video conversion, and when idle is about 700MHz (Ryzen is about 1.4GHz at most), it is good to have high power saving performance.hey.However, if the power limit does not work at all, it will have a hard time cooling.The CPU cooler for TDP65W drops to about 3.0GHz with the thermal slot ring.Still, it is a big deal because the above performance comes out.If you attach a fine CPU cooler, it will always move around 4.0GHz.This is the second generation of P-CORE (single performance specialization) and E-Core (efficiency / multi-performance), which are good at Intel, who makes a wide range of CPUs from ATOM to Xeon.The production process (NM value) tends to be delayed to AMD and ARM, but I think Intel is still excellent in architecture and instruction sets.If you switch from the Tiger Lake (11th generation) below, the performance is not a dream, so you are amazed at the advancement of technology.The built -in GPU is 32 executed units (80 i5 1135g7 of Tiger Lake), so it should be divisible as a bonus.If you are willing to play a little game, add the video card.However, it is convenient to be able to output a monitor without a video card.Recently, even the i5 costs 35,000 yen due to the depreciation of the yen.In the past, I could buy i7 at the same price.。。Recently, the discount mazabo of about 5,000 yen is gone, and it is cheap and costs 15,000 yen, so it is a 50,000 yen course with CPU+Mazabo alone.。。I still think I did a good shopping.[2023/10/29 postscript] As a result of replacing the CPU cooler and stopping TDP65W ...I think that it is inevitable because it is a real OC ignoring the power limit of a 65W rated 65W, but if you use the TDP125W settings in Gigabyte B760M DS3H DDR4, the CPU voltage exceeded 1.4V.The operation becomes unstable from around.It will be stable if you use it at about 1.3V CPU voltage set with TDP100W.It seems better not to use it in mazabo that wants to use the CPU voltage."
957,959,2024-01-22,1,52743,Canada,13500,"Intel chip arrived open, used with wear marks from being installed and traces of thermal paste. Not what I expected. Unimpressed"
958,960,2023-07-26,4,28999,Mexico,13400F,"The product more specifically the processor came well, the processor only, but when I opened the processor box (to assemble my PC), the fan that came with it was broken, but luckily I did not worry, because I had a liquid refigration that already alreadyI had bought and I did not stop to ask for guarantee, because I was only interested in the processor."
959,961,2024-03-27,5,28999,Japan,13400F,The operation is crisp after changing from Ryzen to Intel.Recommended CPU for beginners
960,962,2023-09-18,5,52743,the United States,13500,"I just assembled a new computer using this processor on a Gigabyte B760 with DDR5 memory. The system came up without a hitch and the BIOS screen appeared very professional. I installed Ubuntu 22.04, the only thing I noticed was a hang when installing 22.04.1, so I had to initially select safe mode. I recommend using 22.04.3 (current) because it probably fixes that issue. With 20 cores total this processor is just a downgraded i5-13600k, I don't overclock anyways so it fits my needs. RAM and the sleep function work perfectly (I had trouble with the competitor's)"
961,963,2023-10-28,5,28999,Mexico,13400F,"Excellent CPU for games, supports GPU high ranges"
962,964,2023-03-26,5,20250,the United States,13100,Used it in a fresh build on MSI Mortar wifi and Thermalright assassin x. Temps 3x on idle and 5x on load. Has all needed performance and with integrated graphics is all needed. With Gigabyte Eagle RTX 3060 OC got Fortnite Epic run 130fps @1080p and ~90fps @1440p. Black Mesa ultra @1440p got 100-200fps. Single Con: Could be better priced around 130 though. I decided to have this configuration to have the possibilty to upgrade to 13600k sometime later if needed for Graphics render software.
963,965,2024-03-25,5,28999,Canada,13400F,Upgrade from i5-7400 to this. It's night and day.
964,966,2023-12-01,5,52743,the United States,13500,"This thing performs neck-and-neck with an i7-12700K at half the power draw, with half the heat. It has become my new go-to for sub-$1000 client gaming system builds. Pairs great with any GPU up to an RTX 4070 or an RX 7800-XT"
965,967,2023-11-18,5,28999,the United States,13400F,"So I was stuck on Windows 10 with my LGA 1151 core i7-6700. This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage. Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu. I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu. The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned. I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new. The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that. I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back. My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization. At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%. All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11. Will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good GPU."
966,968,2024-01-26,5,28999,Japan,13400F,"Until now, 6 core 12 threads were the best CPU, but when I purchased it, the CPU with a 10 -core 16 thread was clearly found.I think the challenge is how to make use of this CPU from now on.I don't play much games."
967,969,2024-02-14,4,28999,the United States,13400F,I was having issues with a new build where I wasn't able to adjust any of my fan speeds. The included fan was not spinning faster than about 600 RPM and luckily the processor throttled itself at 100C to prevent death. After taking the fan off and powering it separately it spun up to 3000RPM. I noticed that the wires were pinched along the heatsink because the housing was screwed down too tight. It happens. After fixing it and screwing it back on (not as tight) everything seems to be working. If the CPU wasn't throttling it would have died because of a tiny mistake in the fan wiring go figure.
968,970,2024-01-16,5,52743,Japan,13500,"The Core i5-13500 has high performance and excellent processing power.The 14nm process technology has been adopted, and the clock speed has been improved to up to 4.80GHz.As a result, smooth operation can be expected even in multitasking processing and high -load applications.In addition to improving performance, power saving design is also evolving, improving energy efficiency.As a result, comfortable use in low power state.Because of its excellent performance for the price, it can be said that it is an excellent option in terms of cost.It supports a wide range of applications, such as games, creative work, and general office use, and is recommended for users who want to improve computer performance."
969,971,2023-07-23,5,28999,Mexico,13400F,"It is the fair processor, good performance for most current applications to an excellent price, it works for gamer or productivity assembly, recommended !!"
970,972,2024-06-08,5,52743,the United States,13500,By default it may not boost to its marketing frequency. I had to increase power limit in motherboard settings.

I did notice an improvement over 13400, but unfortunately games started to stutter. I don't know what is the reason. All of my drivers are updated. Graphics card is RTX 4080. I went back to 13400 and everything runs great. I cannot recommend 13500 for a gaming setup, but it really shines with web browsing and productivity."
993,995,2023-10-28,5,52743,the United States,13500,I bought it for its ability to transcode video files and it is working great.

This CPU stood out as it had a lot of cores, good speed specification and without the on board GPU it was a good price. The supplied Intel cooling fan is very good, overall a good purchase."
1012,1014,2024-04-23,5,27500,Australia,13400F,Bang for the buck!
1013,1015,2024-03-09,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,This CPU is well priced and very fast for the price. Very happy customer indeed. Highly recommended!
1014,1016,2024-05-23,5,27500,France,13400F,This processor is very fast.Perfect.No complaints.
1015,1017,2023-04-29,1,27500,the Netherlands,13400F,"This is my first bad experience with the i5 x400F series. Tried it on a fairly decent MSI Z790 Tomahawk motherboard. I tried the i5 8400, 10400F, 11400F and now this 13400F, and this is the first one that dissapoints. The turboboost behavior is not what I'm used to. I do not recommend this one. The performance overall is better then the older ones ofcourse, but the powerlimits and frequencies are all over the place, and not how it should be on paper. Max turbo power should be 143Watts and all core turbo 4.1GHz . My sample's All core turbo didn't go above 3.9GHz and the power draw didn't went above 80 watts. and that's lower then previous gens. Therefore it's underperforming. Weird behavior on this chip. Returned it."
1016,1018,2023-06-20,5,27500,Germany,13400F,"I bought this processor due to its price-performance ratio because I wanted to upgrade my system.The packaging is simple, no irrelevant information and has an appealing effect on me.The processor was added with a boxed cooler, i.e. directly with a suitable air cooler.Using the mainboard is very simple and the feel is very appealing.As always, the product name and the clock frequency is shown on the processor.The CPU has no real competition in its price field that have similar services.The price is also very appropriate.Above all, I like the division of the processor cores, which also fulfills the tasks of the PC separately that the maximum performance has also taken out.The processor has no graphics unit due to the -f marking.The frequency of the processor is quite high and also offers a very satisfactory performance.I only get the CPU on half of the utilization under very difficult conditions.My only criticism here is the air cooler.The CPU does not get too hot with it, but it is quite loud and because of it I would better advise another air cooler or even more.Overall, a very good and recommended product!"
1017,1019,2024-03-26,5,27500,Italy,13400F,"I am now trying that I write this review, I find that it is as required as its predecessor, the 12400f, with 100mHz more that they are not even perceived, perhaps with the architecture a little improved it seems more reactive to me, but it is a feeling probably,data in hand we are there.Like the 12400f with 4 more ecore that probably in the productive environment give that pinch of more calculation that does not hurt.So 10 cores and 16 threads with a 4GHz in gaming clock is very good as always very armored, it has not unlocked, only the frequencies of the RAM can be adjusted, the processor is and that remains, in this intel unfortunately it has always been very tirchy, either take the K series or do not change even a comma.Apart from this philosophical-commercial choice, this processor goes that is a fairy tale, with a 3070 it turns well for us a little and for that handful of Watt that consumes it does not warm up even much.I took it in a moment at offera for € 180 and I believe that in the near future it will give these figures, for a gaming PC, so to speak ""entry level"" at that price is a good deal."
1018,1020,2024-05-02,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,"Many say that he gets a lot of heat but here is normal legal temperature, better cost benefit intel"
1019,1021,2023-06-08,5,27500,Italy,13400F,"I bought this Intel Core i5-13400F processor to update my old PC and I am very happy with my choice.The processor is ideal for those looking for a powerful, fast and efficient processor, suitable for both gaming and work.It has 16 CPUs in total and I find myself much better to editing videos on YouTube.It no longer warms like my old CPU, I am very happy with the choice."
1020,1022,2024-02-28,5,27500,France,13400F,Works well with the first use.
1021,1023,2024-03-16,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,"Leaves an i3 12400f for him and gave a big difference in the games, the only problem is the high temperature, but that a good air cooler already solves"
1022,1024,2023-02-10,5,27500,Spain,13400F,"It is phenomenal.Mounted on a Gigabyte B660m DS3H, Kingston, RX6600 and 2 NVME PCIE 4.0 memories.With liquid cooling of 240 it reaches a maximum of 60 ° with a stress test..Thanks to this unreasonable updated bios plate.It goes very well in games and in general."
1023,1025,2024-04-05,5,27500,Germany,13400F,Very faster CPU. My new PC runs faster than ever and without problems ...
1024,1026,2024-01-08,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,"I knew there was two versions of the i5-13400f based on Alder and Raptor. But the Raptor was as rare as hens teeth in retail, supposedly kept for the OEM market and for slightly more power and without a boxed cooler. Well what did I get? The Raptor around 5% quicker than Alder, anything quicker in pc gaming is a plus. Lol You can also recognize Stepping B0 (Raptor Lake) in a better catalog by the S-Spec code, which is SRMBG. It differs from Stepping C0 (Alder Lake, S-Spec code SRMBN) in the last letter of the designation – “G” instead of “N” Check the CPU die as per my picture. It also shipped with the Laminar RM1 cooler on my MSI MAG Tomahawk WIFI DDR5. Happy days! Check the net for more tech by inputting the two spec codes above. I’m playing Cyberpunk 2077 and an RTX 4060 TI at 1440P everything on ultra using Super DLSS and getting near 100FPS. Bearing in mind it’s both CPU and GPU intensive. Superb processor!"
1025,1027,2024-05-18,5,27500,France,13400F,Very good as a processor

Eye to any bottlenecks in the mating with a GPU (which I have not yet taken). Already witha 4070 we are slightly below"

1046,1048,2023-02-14,5,27500,the United Kingdom,13400F,10 cores for £200! I have this running with a 3070ti with zero processor bottle neck.  Check your motherboards bios before installing though as it will need to be on the latest to run the new 13th gen processors. I found that out the hard way because I bought a new motherboard at the same time and had to borrow a 12th gen processor to be able to update the bios! All good now though running 10/10 and future proof.
1047,1049,2024-02-06,5,27500,Italy,13400F,Damaged article you can have the return thanks

1077,1079,2023-09-25,5,27500,Brazil,13400F,I was surprised ...
1078,1080,2023-06-30,5,27500,Germany,13400F,Works as designed.
1079,1081,2023-04-02,5,27500,Germany,13400F,Price performance is great.Everything as you get used to by Intel
1080,1082,2023-01-20,5,27500,Germany,13400F,Comparable to a 12600k ... a little weaker but significantly less energy consumption .... runs here on a tuf B660 .... absolutely blatant CPU.Price a bit high (still) ... but I couldn't wait :)
1081,1083,2023-05-22,5,27500,Germany,13400F,Super)

1084,1086,2023-07-08,5,27500,France,13400F,Ideal for gaming
1085,1087,2024-06-12,5,31700,India,13500,super speed enough for heavy editing. value for money. i will recommend this. i bought for 23000 rupees before six months.
1086,1088,2023-09-16,5,31700,Sweden,13500,Great cpu for video editing and gaming
1087,1089,2023-07-18,5,31700,the United Kingdom,13500,"There is little reason to look beyond i5 CPUs for anything other than heavy workstation loads.  This CPU with 6 hyper-threaded performance cores (12 threads) plus 8 'efficiency' cores (which are pretty fast in their own right) has a total of 20 threads- it's performance is outstanding.  The best part about it is the efficiency, this is a 65W TDP part (boosts to 154W), and whilst idling is only drawing 15-18W. This makes it very easy to cool. In my small form factor case, I'm able to keep the CPU at 25°C-30°C above ambient temperature.  Whilst gaming, I'm yet to see utilisation above 25%. For productivity loads, it chews through most tasks thrown at it with aplomb.  If you are wanting to overclock, the i5-13600K is the step up you need, but for everything else, this CPU is fantastic."
1088,1090,2024-03-03,5,31700,Italy,13500,"The CPU is excellent and travels very well also in gaming, be careful if you have intentions to overclock the temperatures because if stressed the degrees they go up, consagged!"
1089,1091,2024-03-02,5,31700,Germany,13500,Very economical and quick
1090,1092,2023-12-24,5,31700,Spain,13500,"It is not any i5, it has 14 nuclei and 20 threads, it also consumes 65W, which can be requested more"
1091,1093,2024-02-02,5,31700,Germany,13500,"Play Video CPU is top, I can play with this CPU with my RTX 4070 in all games ultra setting."
1092,1094,2024-01-03,5,31700,France,13500,"Super this i5 13500, taken to replace an i5 9400F.It's impressive.I recommend this processor for office use, video editing.For the game, I cannot give my opinion, I am not a gamer.The integrated video card is more than enough for my use.Small advice, used a good ventirad.It is better to provide it with the assembly.Your processor will make it good."
1093,1095,2024-01-06,5,31700,the United Kingdom,13500,Play Video You can save on cpu cooler but later you will have to get new cooler anyway because it hits 99°C on heavy loads. Good for HTPC and SFF builds.
1094,1096,2023-06-22,5,31700,Sweden,13500,Works great with rtx 3070 and 3000mah
1095,1097,2023-12-11,5,31700,Germany,13500,The i5 is completely sufficient for almost everything.Top performance at the price.Is also enough for gaming
1096,1098,2023-10-29,5,31700,Spain,13500,"I went from an i5 9400f, so better, it seems strange as it was a 9th Gen Intel, but it works very well in conjunction with the RTX 3050 (but would recommend a 3060 or 4060)."
1097,1099,2024-02-09,5,31700,the United Kingdom,13500,It is fast enough for a good gaming experience. I use 1440p with no problems
1098,1100,2024-02-02,5,31700,France,13500,For my first PC I chose this processor renowned to offer work comfort and this is the case!He consumes nothing and heats up very little.He crushed my Mac Mini M1 so easily!
1099,1101,2024-05-15,5,31700,Italy,13500,Very fast CPU excellent for gaming and runs out very little.Recommended who wants a CPU that does not cost much!
1100,1102,2023-01-30,5,31700,Sweden,13500,"Best value cpu nothing else below 13500 in raptor lake series even comes close. Both 13100, and 13400 are truly awful overpriced value at the moment of writing this."

1102,1104,2023-09-23,4,31700,France,13500,"Carton lacks protection, the only reproach"
1103,1105,2024-04-05,4,31700,Italy,13500,"Excellent processor, I'm not sure to find out.But for almost 300 euros the cooler provided is inadequate.At full load the 90 degrees are passed with relative throttling and therefore you lose in performance.I recommend combining the processor with a serious heatsink (I took a Thermalright 120 if an air).Which means setting into account 30-40 euros more for something that had to be decently provided together with the CPU."
1104,1106,2023-07-09,5,31700,the United Kingdom,13500,"This was a replacement for an old Intel 4430, which I thought was fast when I first used it years ago. This is much quicker and has allowed me to load Windows 11. I'm not used to such speed. Obviously there are much quicker CPUs available, but I don't do much processor intensive stuff, so this one is more than sufficient."
1105,1107,2023-03-29,5,31700,Spain,13500,"First of all, I am not an expert in measuring performance and others but the speed and performance jump on a day -to -day life (I am a designer and shot a lot of photoshop/premiere/after) with my previous i7 8700 has been brutal.Do not heat up (with the same ventilados/cooler master dissipator he had for the i7), being 50-65 of the maximum load.Yes, like me, you were thinking about this or an i7 previous generation, do not hesitate, you save money and the performance is great!"

1107,1109,2023-08-20,5,31700,Germany,13500,A very good CPU for a mid -range all -round PC.Very efficient and economical but still powerful ...

1109,1111,2024-03-04,5,31700,France,13500,"Very good mid -range product, perfect for Stream and play at the same time."
1110,1112,2023-03-23,5,31700,Spain,13500,Excellent for any task.Recommended buying for less than € 260

1112,1114,2023-08-17,4,31700,Germany,13500,I bought this processor with a motherboard a few weeks ago. The processor is doing as expected but I removed a star for the bad packaging. Still recommend the processor at 100% !
1113,1115,2023-05-19,5,31700,Sweden,13500,Good price and fast delivery

1121,1123,2024-04-03,5,31700,Italy,13500,"Intel a garanza, recommended."
1122,1124,2023-12-25,5,31700,Italy,13500,"Really excellent if purchased for 250 euros and not 280 as I took it.In my configuration it is combined with a 7800 XT and Asus H770 TUF Gaming Pro Wi-Fi with 32 GB DDR5 6000MHz RAM (which however this processor cannot manage over 4800m and therefore will not go over 4800mHz).In games like cyberpunk in 4k comes to be used at 70/80 % so I would say that it does its job great!As a temp, it arrives on 60grads coupled to an Aio with 500W TDW.Edit and add: in other CPU consumer games such as Battlefield 2042 and Star Citizen and above all in this it starts to struggle, making a slight bottleneck above on 4K where it starts working at 100%... I am starting to think about whether to move on to a more modelPerformant ..."
1123,1125,2024-02-27,5,31700,Italy,13500,Excellent compromise paid just over 13400 arrived with a heatsink that I do not use having the liquid one

Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (with a slight temperature-related deduction)  Should You Buy It?  Absolutely! If you're a hardcore gamer or demanding content creator seeking the best value for performance in the mid-range, and aren't afraid of a little thermal taming, the 13600K is a top contender. Consider alternatives: If budget, power consumption, or Windows 10 compatibility are major concerns, explore Ryzen 5 options or consider the slightly less powerful (and cooler) i5-13500."
1210,1212,2024-03-25,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I have this in my newest rig and it is performing pretty well, very happy with the purchase"
1211,1213,2024-03-22,5,46500,the United States,13600K,I got really lucky and got a high-performing chip. Totally pleased with it and the AI overclocking on my ASUS ROG board.
1212,1214,2023-09-14,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"There's really not much that needs to be said. If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i. If you're considering the CPU but unsure as to its performance, I promise you wont be disappointed with it one bit. Including with its temperatures. No under-volting needed."
1213,1215,2024-02-06,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I waited for a black Friday deal to get this chip, and boy oh boy... I'm blown away! I upgraded from an I5-8600K and the difference was clear, it was not clear eye, it was a monster of a CPU that can tear through any game you throw at it... As long as you pair it with a motherboard that doesn't hold back the power that is this processor."
1214,1216,2024-01-15,4,46500,the United States,13600K,"A great cPU, good value for money, I got mine during the Black Friday sale but do not use it for gaming. Good power as long as it is paired with a good motherboard, Ram and storage."
1215,1217,2024-02-27,5,46500,the United States,13600K,I like that the new PC I built does not slow down when spinning up a Linux VM in Hyper-V. The processor has plenty of threads and supports all the latest features and chipsets.
1216,1218,2023-08-12,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"Update 12-3-23: With the release of the 14ty generation CPUs. Intel barely clawed an extra 1-2% performance wise in the 14600k. Save your money and roll with the 13600k that continues to drop in price. This processor demolishes any workstation/gaming task I throw at it.  Intel nailed the 13th gen i5 loading it up with 14 cores. This thing is a little devil in benchmarks, and for $300(at least) less than the 13900k, you can have a processor that stays in punching distance when gaming. Absolutely killer value of you want to build a gaming rig with a quality processor that doesn't eat $600. I recommend getting the K version just in case for some reason one time you boot and your GPU doesn't read, your computer still has a gui. If you decide to go with an Intel processor, this is the best price to performance option."
1217,1219,2023-05-28,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"Oh, Intel Core i5-13600K, thou art a marvel of technology, A desktop processor that doth claim superiority. With clock speeds swift and cores so many, Thou art a powerhouse for any task plenty.  Thine architecture, like a finely woven tapestry, Doth deliver performance with utmost efficacy. The tasks that once did vex and stall, With thee at helm, they crumble and fall.  Thy clock speeds dance with lightning's might, Bringing forth swiftness to computations in sight. From gaming realms to design and creation, Thou art a boon to any technological vocation.  Thy cores, like warriors in a grand parade, March in harmony, their power never to fade. Multitasking prowess, they do exhibit, As thou handleth multiple tasks, never to quit.  Though thou art not the most noble in Intel's line, Thy value and power, they doth brightly shine. For those who seek a balance of might and cost, Thou art a choice that shall not be lost.  So, let us raise our voices in great acclaim, To Intel Core i5-13600K, a processor of fame. In the realm of computing, thou reigneth high, A true companion for those who reach the sky."
1218,1220,2023-01-23,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I bought this CPU for a media/storage server I was building and I have not been disappointed. I am running Unraid OS with a number of Docker containers including Plex as well as virtual machines. Having 20 vCpus is awesome for some low requirement virtual machines and it's transcoding ability is great for Plex.  A big reason I built a media server in the first place was to store my raw camera footage from storm chasing which is 4k 10bit which creates playback problems on a lot of hardware, it's just too large. I stood up a Plex docker container and added my footage and this CPU handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it's great to go back and easily re-live some of those storms.  We also have a growing library of TV shows and Movies and it also handles streaming those as well.  I imagine this CPU would be awesome for gaming as well, but I don't have any experience with this chip and gaming but there are plenty of reviews that do go over that.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would easily recommend this chip to anyone building a media server."
1219,1221,2024-02-07,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Best price-to-performance ratio in a CPU you would find today
1220,1222,2024-01-07,5,46500,the United States,13600K,This is a very good CPU especially for the price. I love fast computers and don't see any reason to spend a lot more for very marginal gains.
1221,1223,2022-12-16,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I LOVE THIS CPU. It's marketed as a value chip for the performance conscious gamer - at least in the reviews I've seen but that misses the mark. At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well.  My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles.  My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back.  My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9. You'll actually be able to keep it cool with a good cooler. I use a Noctua NH-DL12 with it and it's great."
1222,1224,2024-01-26,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Very fast and everything works just perfect with it
1223,1225,2024-02-09,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Fantastic
1224,1226,2024-01-27,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"The superhero of chips, nough' said. 10/10 -IGN"
1225,1227,2023-11-04,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"If you are building a PC for gaming, look no further than this CPU. Just built a SFF PC with this bad boy and an rtx 4070 for 1440p focused gaming and it absolutely dominates. Getting 240 frames in Overwatch 2 and consistently 200 FPS in single player games in high quality."
1226,1228,2023-10-19,4,46500,the United States,13600K,"Solid update from the 12 series, still selling for too much"
1227,1229,2023-09-13,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I am extremally happy with this CPU. Blazing fast and very stable, runs supper cool. I am only running a dual fan cooler and it idles at 24c and when iRacing stays in hi 40's to low 50's. Only game/ Simulator I use is iRacing. I use some hi-tech 3d modeling programs. Both really stress the CPU. I love this unit, cheap but loads of features."
1228,1230,2023-07-30,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I'm sure it'll be obsolete by the time someone reads this but right now this is the best CPU for the money.  Just look at the benchmark scores. It beats even the best cpus from 2 or 3 years ago and beats i7s from Intels 12th gen easily  Its great for video and audio editing. If it's for gaming, you'll be good with this for 10 years if the last 10 is anything to go by. And you can overclock it too to get even more out of it"
1229,1231,2023-04-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"Absolute best bang for the buck... I wanted to go i9 or at least i7 but with this latest round of intel processors, the extra $100-$150 per upgrade just did not seem worth it. I am very happy with my i5. Paired with an RTX 3060 TI, I am running super smooth with ultra graphics on most games that I am playing.. Currently playing Hogwarts in 4k borderless ultra graphics and ray tracing and maintaining 60 fps on a 4k television... Love it. It is so much faster and smoother than my other PC running the latest AMD processor."
1230,1232,2022-11-26,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"This CPU runs real fast when paired with good RAM. I'm hitting 25,500 in cinebench r23 multi core workload. I manually overclocked it to 5.3ghz p-core, 4.6ghz e-core. It definitely produces a lot of heat, so make sure to get a big AIO or high end air cooler. You do not want to cheap out on a cooling solution or else you'll be leaving performance on the table.  Only gripe with this cpu is the fact that intel markets this as a 14 core cpu, even when the e-cores aren't exactly a big deal in game. Those p-cores do real good work, but the e-cores are lacking. I don't like the $300+ price tag on this, but it does beat Ryzen 7000 series, so I'm satisfied with my purchase."
1231,1233,2023-05-02,5,46500,the United States,13600K,The 13th gen cpu's from intel are very impressive. This i5 is no slouch either and can throw its wieght around with the i7 and i9s of previous generations. In Cinebench i got a score of 23605 points. I have an aio 360 ml cooler on it and my temps rarely get above 50c when Im gaming or editing. At idle it stays around 30c. Under load the temps did not go above 80c. This CPU will pair fine with any gaming setup and its ddr5 compatible with is a bonus.
1232,1234,2023-12-16,5,46500,Canada,13600K,"This cpu can handle 4k at max like making ice cream, and with a 4060 ti is just a cherry on top!  Beast of a cpu."
1233,1235,2023-09-22,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"Up to standards. Worried at the beginning since the processor was not set in place inside the box, but still works normally."
1234,1236,2023-07-09,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I built my mom a new pc with this cpu. It is really fast! Her last computer was 10 years old, this should last at least that long. The on board video this chip supplies works great for what she does which is email, YouTube, ms office."
1235,1237,2023-07-30,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Absolute upgrade compared to my previous CPU but this one spits out heat like the summer sun. I believe you might want to invest with a good CPU cooler and properly do your install but it'll work like a champ.
1236,1238,2023-06-23,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Overclocked with basic settings on a z790 mobo. 5.3ghz easy and maxes at 54 degrees c. under load. I upgraded mobo and cpu from a i7 7700k so I could get windows 11 and reduce my windows boot times from 2 minutes to about 8 seconds.
1237,1239,2023-07-08,5,46500,the United States,13600K,I have been using this quite much and it’s great my laptop has the i7 and I’m use to a quick system and this has exceeded my expectations I have enjoyed the experience and think that I would use again for my next build.
1238,1240,2023-09-28,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Very impressive and outperforms previous gen I9's when gaming while remaining easier to cool.
1239,1241,2023-12-31,5,46500,Canada,13600K,Effective
1240,1242,2023-03-19,4,46500,the United States,13600K,I am using it for a SFF build so not really the target market so if you are on the same boat then be sure to make time to tweak it.
1241,1243,2022-12-02,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I was able to get my 13600K to 5.5GHz on the P Cores and 4.2GHz on the E cores at 1.27V which equals to about 195 Watts at 100% utilization.  Idles at 32C, 55-60C while gaming, and maxes out at 88C on a 10 minute Cinebench23 run. I get a score of 26100 in Cinebench23.  I paired this with an MSI MPG Z690 EDGE WIFI, DDR5 6400 CL32, RTX 3080 & a Thermalright Peerless Assassin CPU cooler..  Gaming performance is amazing!"
1242,1244,2023-09-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,easy hookup for USB and external SATA drives.
1243,1245,2023-09-04,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I liked it a lot, I bought it for gaming and I do not regret my purchase"
1244,1246,2023-10-24,5,46500,Canada,13600K,I am using it with a 4070 ti. Runs everything over 90 FPS in 1440p with ultra graphics!
1245,1247,2023-08-28,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Great for mid range overclocking and pairs well with almost anything. Worth it 100%.
1246,1248,2023-03-05,4,46500,the United States,13600K,"No bottleneck here! i5 13600K is beast! Intel definitely made one hell of a gaming CPU, that performs better than 5800x3d and it’s cheaper."
1247,1249,2023-02-01,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"Upgraded from an i7 8700k and can say I am very happy with my upgrade. I got a noticeable jump in average fps, but the real improvement that can be felt while gaming was the increase in 1% low frame rates.  This processor is a strong performer for the price - especially if you consider using DDR4 RAM if you’re on a tight budget."
1248,1250,2023-01-27,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Went from i7 7700 to i5 12400f to i5 13600k. This processor is going to be in my machine for the next couple years. Probably gonna skip 14th Gen unless it’s mind blowingly better.  I am paired with a 3070 Ti currently. I would have no worries pairing this with any 40 series card. I might wait for next gen GPUs as well.
1249,1251,2022-12-12,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"temps was going crazy high, 100c in 3 of the 6 p cores with msi z690 edge but cinebench complete without throttling, found cpu lite load in oc settings on the board on mode12 the cpu was drawing around 225 watt and this was beyond the cpu specs which is 180 watt changed cpu lite load to mode 1 now the max temps are 87 and watt is around 195  great CPU"
1250,1252,2023-07-04,5,46500,the United States,13600K,For gaming this CPU is the best investment you can make... Only weakness is multitasking high end video editing...
1251,1253,2023-07-14,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"swapped out my 10850k @5Ghz for this chip, and across the board outperforms it for less power and thermals"
1252,1254,2023-05-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"Get a good Z790 chipset motherboard, and overclock this thing to ~5.7 and you'll have the performance of a chip that's 2-3x the price for most users."
1253,1255,2023-04-11,5,46500,the United States,13600K,I thought the 13th generation Intel processor were suppose to run hot. This one does not with a 240mm radiator; with the radiator temperature is in the 30's while gaming. At idle 20s.
1254,1256,2022-12-11,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"This is my first intel system I built. Always been AMD and saw the 13th gen out. Figured was worth a try. It did not disappoint. Only thing is the MSI board overvolts it stock, so temps were always hitting 100 degrees, even with water cooling. Set the Vcore to 1.2v and no longer getting hot."
1255,1257,2023-02-15,5,46500,the United States,13600K,absolutely annihilate everything I throw at it. if you're bot doing some serious rendering and only gaming then this CPU is for you. the 13600k should be good for another 10-15 years of gaming 5.10ghz 20 cores is enough to destroy anything you throw at it
1256,1258,2023-05-22,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"It is already installed on my computer is wonderful, it has not given me any problem and yields in everything I need."
1257,1259,2022-12-01,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"Paired the i5 13600k with MSI Z690-A Pro DDR4. Running P-Cores 5.4GHz and E-Cores 4.2GHz without any issues. Efficiency cores are powerful and they're equivalent to i7 9700k from few years ago. Scores 25,592 in Cinebench 23 with all cores, and 16,507 with E Cores disabled. Simply put, amazing! Can't ask for more. This CPU has no competition, period!"
1258,1260,2023-04-15,5,46500,the United States,13600K,I think this CPU offers GREAT value for the money. I runs everything at full settings (with 3060 GPU) and stays cool with Noctua air cooling. Recommended!
1259,1261,2023-05-25,5,46500,the United States,13600K,Fantastic Chip!! Runs Cool!! And Super Fast!! Just buy it-You know you Want it!! :)
1260,1262,2023-02-11,5,46500,the United States,13600K,"I upgraded from an i7-9700k to the i5-13600k. WOW! Huge difference. Faster load times, better gaming frame rates in games that depend on the CPU more than the GPU, no stuttering in intense games. I am impressed. Nice job, Intel."
1261,1263,2023-06-23,3,46500,Canada,13600K,"Bios flash to update the motherboard for it to be able to use this 13th gen CPU, but the flash didn't work so the CPU could never be read by my ASRock Steel Legend motherboard. I have to buy a 12th gen CPU instead because of this problem assuming its the CPU that wasn't compatible with it."
1262,1264,2023-09-20,5,46500,Canada,13600K,plug and plug. superb performance gaming
1263,1265,2022-11-08,5,46500,Canada,13600K,"Loving the price to performance with the 13600k, considering I made the upgrade from a 6700k. The technology is leaps and bounds for roughly same value.  There is also no reason to choose an AMD5 CPU this year over the 13th gen Intel chips. Maybe a X3D but definitely not the 7000 series of CPUs."
1264,1266,2023-03-24,5,46500,the United States,13600K,I had a 10700k before this. Day and night. Paired with a 4080 and it does 1440p 240hz on most titles without hiccups.
1265,1267,2023-09-03,5,59999,India,13700K,This processor is absolutely incredible with no doubt’s… The only this you have to keep in mind that go for atleast 360 AIO for more better performance…

1267,1269,2023-01-14,5,59999,India,13700K,This is my best buy so far for gaming and editing. It runs great whatever you throw. Excellent performance so far. Cinebench score is 29000 at 125 TDP.  Suggestion: Buy only if you have very good amount of cooler.
1268,1270,2024-06-17,4,59999,India,13700K,good
1269,1271,2024-03-08,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"I bought this to replace my 10850k after I realized how much it was holding back my 4090. I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram. The difference was night and day! I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back. I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs. I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast! I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed. I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is. I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads."
1270,1272,2024-06-13,5,59999,Canada,13700K,"Upgraded to the 13700k from the 11900k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive. This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day? May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these high-end CPU's more or less all perform equal (or would if they all worked properly), but it's easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30-day window for return to Amazon is closed."
1271,1273,2023-12-29,5,59999,Japan,13700K,"In combination with RTX4070TI, most of the current games can be played with 4K settings.It is cooled with simple water cooling, but the fans are quiet even in the game."

If you're looking for the ultimate in gaming and multi-core performance and have the budget for a premium build, the i7-13700K is a worthy investment. Just be prepared to feed it some serious watts and keep it cool.  Note:  This review is based on my own research and comparison of benchmarks. Your results may vary depending on your specific hardware and software configuration"
1276,1278,2023-03-14,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,"Excellent processor delivery, by the seller, arrives in a small box, (he had read from the pulparindo - confirmed).The functionalities provided by the processor are the best with 24 Threads, always advisable to get a good liquid cooling.At the moment I use the assembly for virtualization issues and is more than left over."
1277,1279,2023-07-24,5,59999,Canada,13700K,"This processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old i7-6700K. According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).  Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan): - System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings - Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads - Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirector  Note that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).  If you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium. If you also don’t plan to overclock, consider the i7-13700F."
1278,1280,2023-03-01,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,"The processor is excellent, quite fast for all tasks, the only one against it is the temperatures it handles, so I recommend matched with a good cooling system.The excellent seller's service, I smile when I saw that the processor was packaged with a pulparindo, would give him another star just because of that!"
1279,1281,2023-04-29,5,59999,Japan,13700K,"I heard that air -cooled could not be exhausted, but it was normally exhausted.I don't know if it's overloaded ...It's okay if you use a browser or play games normally."

1281,1284,2023-10-19,2,59999,Brazil,13700K,"The processor is excellent, but delivery was desired, because it took a long time, another detail the box arrived all kneaded, lucky not to damage the processor."
1282,1285,2023-01-14,5,59999,Japan,13700K,"If you turn around 250W without power limit, i7 12700K is not opponent, but it is a performance that lightly pulls the i9 12900K, but it is too explosive as other people say ... but even if you just set it to 190W (the same as i7 12700K).I am astonished CPU that surpasses the i9 12900K, so I (simple water cooling) is satisfied with the performance deterioration itself.If you absolutely want to use it in air cooling (large), it seems that if it is around 140W, it can be cooled without any problem and it can be operated with lower power at all stronger than i7 12700K.Conclusion: A CPU with the best wat performance and a gentle fever if the power is restricted.It seems like Intel has been in vain to compete with a rival CPU."
1283,1286,2023-09-26,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,"I get fast, work very well"
1284,1287,2024-06-16,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Wow welcome to a real gaming cpu. This runs good, have not OC, stays cool with my 360aio. No stability issues, nothing but a great freakn experience. Very happy with this purchase."
1285,1288,2023-07-20,5,59999,Canada,13700K,"This is my first upgrade since the i7-4790k, this processor is a BEAST! Eats away at any task i throw at it without a sweat! I was a little hesitant with the new cpu designs with the Performance and efficiency cores but man, the efficiency cores alone kill my 4790k! 👌🏻 great cpu, just make sure you know these shoot to the sky heat wise when you punch heavy workloads and you will need cooling to match depending of how long and how much you will need to pull away from it. 👍🏻"
1286,1289,2024-02-20,5,59999,Canada,13700K,"No surprises here, the cpu functions exactly as advertised."

I have started a lot at the same time, such as distribution software, but there is no lack of processing performance so far.However, the heat is easy to hold.I don't know if it can be cooled if it is air -cooled ... I use simple water cooling!For your reference!"
1289,1292,2024-05-16,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Purchased on sale for $334. The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt. Intel is still my preference for CPUs and I don't foresee that changing, especially with all of the issues I've read regarding AMD chips (boot up issues, crashes, poor multi-core performance)."
1290,1293,2022-11-23,5,59999,Japan,13700K,"I was worried about the top model Core i9-13900K, but I chose this Core i7-13700K, which has improved peak performance and wattage with the same specifications of the core.It is operated on the Z690 motherboard, but there is no problem if the BIOS is compatible.Recent motherboards can be updated by BIOS if only power supply can be updated, so it is often not problematic even with non -supported BIOS.It is recommended that the device drivers are updated in advance (or downloaded for new installation).The score of Cinebenchr23 is multi -30552 and single 2082.The score is about 10 % from the Core i9-12900K, and the power consumption during the full load is about 30W lower, so it feels good.I think that it is doing well with a process rule that has dropped a few generations compared to the current product of 10nm and other companies, but the 360mm simple water -cooled cooler is the same as Alder Lake.The watt performance at full load is honestly subtle.This time, I was very satisfied because it was for gaming PCs, so I will not encoding the video.Encoded processing Main recommends Ryzen 9 5950X, which is an old model that works without any problems with a large air -cooled cooler, but is easy to handle and is cheap.If it is a game main, the Core i7-13700K with high single thread performance is recommended because it has high wattage and cost performance!"
1291,1294,2023-03-27,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,"It was what I expected, the delivery was in less the planned time and they took the trouble to include in gratitude for the purchase, excellent attention."
1292,1295,2024-05-17,5,59999,the United States,13700K,I am a team blue guy. And I think this is a great cpu for the money. Currently running at 5200 and very stable.
1293,1296,2023-10-26,5,59999,Canada,13700K,"What can you say about this processor that hasn't already been said. Just know you need a good cooler on it, because it does get HOT! Performance is great and with Intel's XTU app it is easy to overclock and achieve even more."
1294,1297,2023-12-06,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"My previous build had an i7-9700K and after 5 years of abuse, I decided to upgrade in this new build to an i7-13700K and I'm not disappointed. It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it. Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup. During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues.

1296,1299,2022-11-24,4,59999,Canada,13700K,Really love this processor it’s really fast using the adobe apps. Recommended for content creation.
1297,1300,2023-06-19,4,59999,the United States,13700K,"After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year. I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out... Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again."
1298,1301,2023-12-03,5,59999,Canada,13700K,"fast arrived, well packaged, safely packed, but , one thing i almost put 1 star the delivery person put the box on a heating radiator in my apartment entrance, but overall product is high quality"
1299,1302,2023-04-03,5,59999,Mexico,13700K,Great
1300,1303,2024-06-02,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"I would have opted for a slower/cheaper version if I'd known it ran this hot. But it works and will probably be fairly future-proof for a while. Most of what I do doesn't tax it at all, so it's cool and stable."
1301,1304,2024-05-10,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Overlocking the crap out of this with liquid cooling. Rock solid - not a blue screen in site. Dedicate 8 cores to a VM with no appreciable decline in bare metal OS operation. Temps are higher with the same cooler as compared to 12700k (12700k running 30-40C under load, this jumps to the 50-60C area pretty quick."
1302,1305,2024-06-07,5,59999,the United States,13700K,Good deal and for the delivery
1303,1306,2023-12-26,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"The highest package temps my CPU gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees Celsius. And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how. Long story short if you want max performance to play around with just get a i9 processor, that's what those are made for, for everyone else there's this one!"
1304,1307,2024-05-11,5,59999,the United States,13700K,A very good midrange processor. I've use one for years and it has always worked well for me.
1305,1308,2023-11-01,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"I use this i7-13700K every day for about a year. I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use. Is it all of this the fastest? I have no idea. Does it boot and work reliably everytime so far? Absolutely!"

Baby in the background couldn't believe it. Thank you Amazon for coming through once again with a formidable solution. Paid the extra $100 to make sure the problem of the i5 did not continue to occur. Problem solved!"
1308,1311,2024-04-03,5,59999,the United States,13700K,Just what I needed. It is fast and it's not annoying. Used it for a small rig.

Everything opens almost instantly, whether it be Windows 11's File Explorer, Edge browser and webpages, and opening files in general. I upgraded primarily because I am a developer, and Visual Studio + Dotfuscator would take almost 8 minutes to compile and obfuscate my largest program on my old build.

This processor works faster and better compared to what I had previously. This cpu is basicaly like an efficient i9 12900k, so if your looking for a high end processor just get this 13th gen. Also at this time the 14th gen i7 just got released but based on the reviews its more like a 13th gen Intel ks proccesor. That why I never went that route."

I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.  I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).  I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.  TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade. I don't claim to be Steve from Gamers Nexus, or a pro CPU tester - but I can tell you that this thing is amazing, and will serve you well for years to come."

I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard’s vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD’s expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me). I also like to note the CPU fits only fits one way and the CPU lever has a bit of tension, so don’t be afraid when installing your CPU."
1320,1323,2023-12-13,4,59999,the United States,13700K,"The second purchase of the product, fulfilled its characteristics."
1321,1324,2023-10-03,4,59999,the United States,13700K,I’m sure the chip works beautifully but I had no idea the k series didn’t come with a cooler which is very upsetting for the price point. I now realize very small at the bottom of description it says no thermal cooling. Wish it said that in the main details.
1322,1325,2024-02-20,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Nothing to say, all is okay"
1323,1326,2023-10-16,4,59999,the United States,13700K,"fast cpu, did not come with a cpu cooler. Make sure you get a good cpu cooler if you play games!!! This cpu runs very HOT if you max it out. Recommend water cooler or LARGE air cooled."
1324,1327,2024-01-15,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Running in XMP mode, all cores synced, with ram clocked at 7200mhz! No problems whatsoever. Runs fast and cool compared to my old 5930k."
1325,1328,2023-01-15,4,59999,the United States,13700K,"I got this for a new system build even though a little higher than I like to spend. But it has performed great. After, I noticed a drop in performance and doing research, I found out that these run very very hot and the thermal protection had kicked in to throttle the processor down. I tried a few Air cooled options that did the trick, but they were too loud for me, so I ended up with a Liquid cooled option which is what I would recommend to anyone using this processor. Currently, my idle temps are around 41c and at 100% utilization, temps average around 60-70 with a quick peak of 95. I dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons, but I did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what I did. 13th Gen blows away 12th gen. This I7 even bests the i9 12th gen. Great chip as long as you keep it cool."
1326,1329,2023-08-06,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"The i7 runs a bit hotter than the 13th gen i5, but I just couldn't resist spending a bit more for those extra cores. As of 2023, it's a razor-fast CPU for the average buyer - probably too powerful for anyone but power-users and video-editors. As for gaming, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problems, too.  It CAN run with a low-power or stock-quality cooler for daily tasks, but I'd recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavy-duty loads at it, or good-performance air cooling if you're planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future."
1327,1330,2023-12-18,5,59999,the United States,13700K,I wanted speed without breaking the bank and this CPU fits the bill. Runs a little hot but not too much to handle with an AIO water cooler (I use a Deepcool LT520). Pleased with my build.
1328,1331,2024-02-09,5,59999,the United States,13700K,its great. just buy it. or the 14700k.
1329,1332,2023-12-29,5,59999,the United States,13700K,Open box/used good condition item. Purchased for my Wife's latest build... Wound up having a better memory controller than my old 13900KS ... run really cool.
1330,1333,2023-12-14,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Absolutely great CPU, fast, efficient, and perfect for gaming. It’s the ideal CPU for gamers, especially coming from a 9700k. I noticed drastic improvements in my gaming and I highly recommend for others. Great buy."
1331,1334,2023-04-06,4,59999,the United States,13700K,"If you are looking to get the best gaming experience with the decent price and not getting poor processing power, this is your option, you get the flagship power with lower price than competitor.  It is usually huge amount of power however in load, but for person like me keeping OC most of the time, this is where E cores getting into the play.  I'm not Intel fan anymore, I wanted to get AMD but because AMD requires DDR5 and much expensive for no payback compared to Intel, I did choose this, and I'm not regretting it.  So TL;DR: if you are short in budget, and want something last long for next years, get this one fore sure."
1332,1335,2023-09-28,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Very impressive CPU almost on par with the i-9 just slightly fewer e-cores which if your not an editor or creator of some sort you really won't miss them. Gaming wise this CPU has hit all my benchmarks, with a solid score on cinebench time after time. Runs a little hot while gaming among other things roughly around 65 to 72°C at highest times, but with the right cooler you will be impressed! Does not come with stock cooler! Would recommend"
1333,1336,2023-07-12,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"I replaced a 7th generation I7 CPU with this one. The difference in performance is dramatic (although I the also replaced the MOBO, which contributed to the improvement). I may have bought too much CPU power. The ASUS diagnostics that I run show that the CPU rarely runs at more than 10% of capacity (although I also installed a new GPU so most of the graphics processing is offloaded).  Installation in the ASUS motherboard was straightforward, although the socket size has changed from my previous Intel CPU, and I had to purchase a new mounting bracket for my cooler, which I did not replace."
1334,1337,2023-11-22,5,59999,the United States,13700K,Super fast and stable CPU. Note that it can run hot because of the higher voltage it can use. I made sure to get a nice AIO for it. Coupled with an arctic freeze II 306 it rarely gets above 30C.
1335,1338,2023-09-19,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"It’s insane, the speed you get for its price is absolutely great. It’s granted me a 40+ fps increase on Baldur’s Gate and has helped me in development and lighting in 3D applications. It been stable at 5.4 ghz and is amazing for games. The die is larger than the older CPUs due to its newer lga1700 chipset, so I recommend getting the ThermalRight contact frame (also have a review for it). OVERALL worth it, better if you get it on discount."
1336,1339,2023-11-01,4,59999,the United States,13700K,Product is great. Delivery was a let down.
1337,1340,2024-01-10,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"It is what it is, an action packed CPU"
1338,1341,2024-01-17,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Nice processor works great, stays cool."
1339,1342,2022-12-07,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"Above are screenshots of my Passmark benchmark, both systems exactly the same, except the first picture has the 13700K and the second picture has the 12700K in it. The rest of the components are HX1200, Asus ROG Maximus Hero Z690, Gskill Trident DDR5 F5 6000Mhz, Adata Legend 840 SSD X2 set up in RAID 0. Vetroo Lurker 240mm AIO water cooling, Power color RX 6900 XT. I run all (P) cores synced at 5300 MHz. Temps idle at about 32 to 35C, hard benchmarking takes it up as high as 88 C once, typically about 75C. Ordinary gaming, tasking takes it to about 45 to 50C. If you are wondering if its worth the upgrade, it is. But considering that my system is one of the fastest in the world with these components, I would have to say that upgrading to a Z790 motherboard is NOT worth it if you already have a Z690. That is all, and good day to you."
1340,1343,2023-12-15,5,59999,the United States,13700K,So I am building my new system starting with I7-13700k upgrading from my pre built Alienware I7-9700k it came out incredible and fast. Love Intel.
1341,1344,2023-04-10,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"If you’re looking at this as a gaming-only processor, you’ll probably get 95% of the gaming performance this offers with the cheaper and cooler i5-13600k. Save your money and put it into a better GPU over buying this because that will actually result in more FPS where this processor (over the 13600k) will not.  That being said, this processor is a monster. It’s a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up. Most stable and speedy system I’ve ever owned. 13th gen might have come out before Ryzen 7000 series, but I still think it’s the winner.  EK’s Nucleus 360mm AIO did a great job at keeping this CPU under control."
1342,1345,2023-07-17,4,59999,the United States,13700K,"Upgraded from Asus Prime Z390-A (i7 9700k) to Asus ROG Strix Z790-1 Wifi D4 (i7 13700k). Using Noctua NH-U12A air cooler. Temperatures around 60 C when gaming, with spikes around 75 C. Most users report this processor tends to run hot. I have not stress tested but have heard reports of throttling when under extreme (not typical user) load. Overall happy with the choice."
1343,1346,2023-10-15,4,59999,the United States,13700K,good intel cpu but overpriced. good graphics with intel 770 uhd.
1344,1347,2023-04-23,5,59999,the United States,13700K,"This was the first Generation 13 processor we used in a build. Of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that. Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation. The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2°-3° C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions. All in all, obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can't see justification for anyone taking their i9-12900k out and installing i9-13900k. The gains would probably not be really experienced."

I recommend this CPU for 8K gaming and stream."
1348,1351,2023-11-10,3,82350,India,13900K,"It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80°C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80°C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80°c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.  But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors."

It works really good, very very fast, and can ***multi task heavy software like they're nothing*** and with a push pull AIO it averages around 28*C and when I'm gaming it stays around 50-40*C with graphics maxed out. Much love and gratitude to Intel! This works great with gaming and also data science, which work is the main reason I bought this. I also used the Thermal Grizzly - KryoSheet (38x38x0,2mm) for this as well so I don't have to worry about paste drying up on my i9 <3 and lemmy tell you it fits PERFECTLY and pairs well with a CPU contact frame too, and after almost half a year I've yet to have any problems, only good results."

The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity. Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work. Yes I know this CPU runs notoriously hot, but it seems a good quality AIO tames it well. I have the 13900k running on an Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master X motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and I use the NZXT Kraken 360 Elite to cool it. The Kraken Elite does manage the heat well and my systems idles at 28-29 degrees. This CPU is way overkill for a gamer, but for someone like me that does a lot of 3D modeling and rendering, its great. I do have the cpu slightly overclocked using the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility in automatic overclock. I have not had any crashes and havent noticed any thermal throttling at all with this setup."

1378,1381,2024-05-31,3,82350,Canada,13900K,"We set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday - to make a long story short, we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7-11th gen we had from before.  The surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines, we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others. We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W. And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.  One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot. We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A. We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly. So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.  Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up. We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again. This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.  So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective This is a huge surprise. These systems had no GPU, only motherboard, 64GB of DDR5, and an SSD. Has anyone else seen this?"
1379,1382,2024-03-22,4,82350,the United States,13900K,"Got it for my gaming machines, but all my games crashes when trying to play."
1380,1383,2023-12-29,4,82350,the United States,13900K,"This CPU unit is a beast, upgraded from a i7 8700k...the improvement was HUGE. Doubled my FPS in WoW, and there is no more lag! Nevertheless, after 6 months of regular use, it started failing...many kernel errors until it finally became useless. I could, somehow, return it to INTEL (from Perú to USA). Great support outside US...but such a complex and expensive unit cannot fail that quickly without heavy usage, at least in my opinion."
1381,1384,2023-02-22,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset. It didn't boot when I set it all up. It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU. Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard. I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update. After that it boots this CPU just fine. Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter. I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache. But, it just doesn't compete with this i9. I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores. Even with less cache. The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works. It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD. I use a water cooler, but it's not required. Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5. I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more. But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available. If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you. It will NOT disappoint.  A word on the X790 chipset. You would think they will have better performance because they are newer. They don't. They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update. They have one more USB port. But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more. So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great."
1382,1385,2023-11-14,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"I really like this CPU and it has worked well for my needs. Many had the issue of overheating, throttling and even bending in some instances. I have not experienced any of this since I knew exactly what settings needed adjusted in the BIOS to keep this monster CPU running cool. It seems that motherboard manufacturers tend to turn these up way past their limits by default and that was what caused all the issues. All you need to to is look up the specs for your CPU and setup the BIOS of your motherboard accordingly.  I am using the Aorus Waterforce X 280 with Artic MX-6 Thermal Paste just in case you are curious. This has also been installed on the GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX motherboard.  As long as you set this up correctly you will not have any issues and will get a great performing CPU."
1383,1386,2024-02-05,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"I did end up returning it because of a motherboard issue. I do have a 12900k, and many other types and they all perform as expected. I would recommend Intel processors to those looking for something for general all around performance. As the 14900k and 13900k are basically the same, I would say get this one unless you can find the 14900k for the same price."
1384,1387,2023-09-28,4,82350,the United States,13900K,"Using Phantek Glacier D30 360mm cooler, during heavy stress load it gets around 82-84C. Just gaming in heavy modded Skyrim, FFXIV, and Total Warhammer 3 stays around 50-55C.  Those complaining about temps higher than that while just gaming likely do not have their cooler mounted properly or too low end of a cooler.  Make sure coolers plastic film is removed from metal block if it has that, apply plenty of thermal paste if cooler doesnt come pre applied with any, and evenly screw on the mounting screws to keep pressure as evenly as possible till all are set."
1385,1388,2023-09-19,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"When it comes to going over the top for a PC upgrade, this CPU is the undisputed heavyweight champion. I, too, dabble in video editing, 3D modeling, and an array of demanding tasks, and let me tell you, this powerhouse just devours them with sheer gusto. Paired with a Kraken water cooler, it operates like a well-oiled machine, showing absolutely no signs of throttling, even under the most intense workloads. And as for those so-called ""CPU-intensive"" games, well, they might as well be child's play for this beast. If you're seeking the best of the best, look no further – this CPU is the crown jewel in the kingdom of processors, and it's here to make your computing dreams come true. It's not just top-tier; it's top of the world, and it laughs in the face of anything you throw its way. A true marvel of technology that's worth every penny!"
1386,1389,2023-08-10,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"This processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card. I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesn’t generate that much heat either. I previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4K so sadly I had to retire my old build. Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, don’t be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don’t want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent. Good luck gamers and editors. Just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor. AMD processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do."
1387,1390,2024-02-16,5,82350,the United States,13900K,this is a beast of a CPU this thing destroys anything you can throw at it.can download surf the net while gaming and it doesnt bat a eye.and she runs much cooler than the tubers are showing turn your volts to 1.37v and done. Amazing power !!!
1388,1391,2023-05-15,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"It’s so good, and that makes sense since it’s top of the line right now (imagine that.) Going from my 9900k to this was like a spiritual enlightening but ALSO I must add this is totally unnecessary unless you’ll be working with heavy loads, unreal engine, 4k video editing and streaming, 4k gaming, or anything that requires overclocking.  Buying this bad boy will future proof your computer for now, BUT there are very few people who NEED this kind of cpu. If you’re shopping for your build right now and considering this, if it’s in the budget and you want something that’ll handle literally whatever you want then yes, this is great. But just remember, whatever you want might not be as intense as this thing accounts for.  Now that I’ve warned you about not needing this; let me just say how happy I am that I got it. I do a lot of 4k editing and streaming and there is no issue, runs smoothly and efficiently (does get hot though) if you’ve got a good cooler on this then you’ll be good to go for a long time."
1389,1392,2023-02-24,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST. Both worked the first time. Do you need 24 cores for games? Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not. Video editing can benefit from the extra cores. Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked). Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution. Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility. I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler. With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor. While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C. Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C. Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer. Don't overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 C."
1390,1393,2024-02-05,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"Installation is easy. It does run a little hot so you need a good cooler. I use a dedicated all-in-one water solution from corsair, and the package temp never exceeds 75."
1391,1394,2023-12-25,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"As per benchmarks, this CPU performs way better than AMD 7950x3D. Although, you will just get 3-4 frames higher while gaming in AMD 7950x3D CPU but what's the point? Intel is still leading in single core score! Power consumption is almost same. Intel is Apple and AMD is Android. End of story!"
1392,1395,2023-03-11,4,82350,the United States,13900K,"This thing puts enough heat out to power a thermal generator, and I really am not kidding. Water cooling ONLY unless you want to melt your board or destroy the high dollar part. I would also recommend a large radiator too, 3 fan coverage. This thing is an excellent space heater.  Outclasses thread ripper by almost double its paces per benchmarking in multicore. Handles everything I throw at it then yawns at me as if it was boring and mediocre work.  Simply put, leader of the pack right now and handles literally anything I’ve tried to hit it with, even running multiple games at once (when combined with a good GPU, naturally).  I have zero complaints. I’ve learned to hate a lot of intel items over the years, but this truly is a marvel."

1395,1398,2023-05-29,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"Excellent processor. It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one. Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100°C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67°C) but is something to be aware of. All in all happy with this beast"
1396,1399,2023-10-04,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"Probably more than what I need for gaming, maybe I should have gotten a 13700k instead to run a little cooler. This gets HOT on my Dark Rock Pro 4. I want to get a 360mm AIO to help cool this. I ruined a motherboard trying to use a contact frame, afraid to use one again. Contact frame went in the trash, so another motherboard would not. Using the stock CPU holder/ loading mechanism."
1397,1400,2023-06-28,5,82350,the United States,13900K,"If it have the money to spare and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) its a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it to most users.  If you're just using the PC as a high-end gaming rig an i7-13700k is more than enough even with a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the cheaper 13700k. Also this processor is notoriously hot, so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm+ watercooler AIO is necessary (especially for overclocking)."

1399,1402,2023-07-02,1,82350,the United States,13900K,"It worked fine for 6 months, then i start running into Error Code 0xC0000005 with lots of various applications in Windows 11. I figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing, and I dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues. I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues. I try replacing the memory, still issues. I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues. I try windows 10.... still issues. I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.  I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code. They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU. They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up. So, i go and pick up the machine.  I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person. We spend 1 hour typing about the issue. I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.  I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket. I open up chat again, i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address. They assign it and forward the support response to me.  And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it. And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.  An OS issue. I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter. I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter. So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.  It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.  Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky."

Fast install onto a Supermicro Board x13SAE-f with server memory with IPMI for remote access or an Asus Board such as Z690-f with DDR5 where you can buy an IPMI attachment, and it throttles rather than crashes when it overheats. Or just for gaming and office use this CPU beats everything else to date. Buy one now and if you have an i9-12900K or KF sell it. Pay attention to the necessary new BIOS install. Not one crash to date but occasional throttling down when stressed as CPU temperature gets too high occurs now and again but not very often and sure stronger Air Fan or water cool fix that if it bothers you. Same thing happens on my more than twice the price Thread Ripper 3970x and not a big deal. This a server class CPU."

Get yourself an AIO cooler like the Artic Freezer II 360 size and you're all set. No real need to overclock this CPU. It also works great for heavy applications and gaming. Has plenty of fast L 3 cache on die so there's no delay or speed issues. It also runs my Team Group DDR 5 7800Mhz ram with no problem on my Maximus Z790 Hero chipset Motherboard. Wanted to get the EVGA Z790 Kingpin motherboard but it sells out very fast within minutes. Great CPU and I'm very happy that I've bought the Intel 13900K.

Trouble shot my mobo/aio/bios for a couple days. Rralized it was a hot chip or a bad heat sensor in it. Got the new one today. 81°c uder full load. Never know what ur gunna get. Now i get to wait 30 days for my money back. At least its sorted.
1425,1428,2023-03-15,5,82350,the United States,13900K,Just installed this in my new build and I have to say it is AMAZING! My one warning to anyone inexperienced with the newer CPUs is be prepared for the heat. After a lot of work I was finally able to get this down to an average of 30 - 40 degrees Fahrenheit during light loads. When under a heavy load such as Cyberpunk at max everything at 4k. I get about 70 - 79 degrees Fahrenheit. This beast is HOT! but utterly incredible in its performance.
1426,1429,2023-10-25,2,59100,India,14700K,What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money
1427,1430,2023-10-23,5,59100,India,14700K,Beast gaming world 2nd most powerful processor my set up has this processor and RTX 4070 16gb ram 2048gb(2tb) nvme m.2 ssd 850 watts pls buy it
1428,1431,2024-04-19,5,59100,Japan,14700K,"Since 7700K does not support Windows11, I chose this because I had to build a new PC soon.I've used i7 with K until now, so I did that again.Even though 7700K is 91w of power consumption, this is 253W, and the centerpiece popped out.The 7700K was cool enough with Toru, but it seemed impossible, and the cooler chose Deepcool's AK620.If the power limit is applied to 125W, it will settle to about 70 degrees, and it seems to be usable with confidence.If the grease is applied appropriately, it will be a little lower.Although it is an important feeling of use, there is 28 cores including logical cores, so there is a sense of security that it will not be heavy even if you do a good work.Considering my usage, it is an overspec, but it is better to be relieved to buy a high performance and buy enough than regret that the performance is not enough later.I am.The reason I keep buying i7 is this sense of security.It is also an advantage for me that power restrictions are needed.Normally, if you limit 125W, it will lead to a sense of security that you can cancel the limit in an emergency (I will not come in case of emergency. I know) I7 also buy sufficient security.I think it was."
1429,1432,2023-12-08,5,59100,Japan,14700K,Use it for the first time.240mm can cool down with simple water cooling.
1430,1433,2024-01-18,5,59100,Canada,14700K,"Arrived earlier than expected, a very good Cpu. Expansive but what could we do."
1431,1434,2023-12-10,4,59100,Japan,14700K,"The previous CPU is 4790k of 4 generations, so it is 10th generation.Is it just the right performance among 14 generations?"
1432,1435,2024-03-24,5,59100,Germany,14700K,"With sufficient cooling, there is also about 60 degrees in gaming operation."
1433,1436,2024-05-31,5,59100,the United States,14700K,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.  Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.  So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.  I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."
1434,1437,2024-06-02,4,59100,the United States,14700K,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.  There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."
1435,1438,2024-05-03,4,59100,the United States,14700K,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.  The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).  Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days."
1436,1439,2024-06-13,5,59100,the United States,14700K,"Still love Intel despite their lack of anything groundbreaking recently. CPU’s still work great for gaming, this one included. Works right out the box and went perfect with my new MSI motherboard too."
1437,1440,2024-05-31,5,59100,the United States,14700K,I was able to get 240fps in CS go and valorant without external GPU. I previously had 6th gen i7 and GTX980. And that couldn't pull this. Lightroom rendering is also good i am able to color correct 100 raw pics in seconds. I didn't expect this performance when i updated.
1438,1441,2024-05-01,5,59100,the United States,14700K,"Switching from a 5800x3d for my 4080 super.. this is one heck of a cpu. I only put a $60 280mm aio ""I'd cooling"" and put it on smart fan. After that gaming has been a breeze with crazy high fps that give me 99% GPU usage in every game. Jedi survivor is getting over 130fps with dlss quality on. Which is unheard of from everything I read. Totally glad I went with this over 7800x3d. Mobo was much cheaper with every bell and whistle I wanted. My newest build is definitely nice enough to leave any builder drooling.. Thanks to this cpu at its core."
1439,1442,2024-04-05,5,59100,the United States,14700K,"Upgrading from a 10700KF to 14700K. Lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but I’m here to tell you it’s well worth the money! Just make sure to go to your BIOS and limit the power to 253W. The whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion. I haven’t gotten heat issues while gaming.  Overall I have this chip paired with a 3090, while I’ll wait for a new 50 series card.  Some of the gains I’ve gotten at @1440P, 45 in ultra wide 21:9, max graphics settings:  Overwatch: overall 50fps gain, consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor. Black Desert Online: overall 35-40 fps gains.  These are the games I normally play a lot and it’s truly notice when upgrading to this chip. Overall the computer is a snappy and fast and haven’t notice any hiccups. Really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4-5 years."
1440,1443,2024-05-08,4,59100,the United States,14700K,I'm using this as a server CPU mostly for the SR-IOV capable GPU stability has been an issue when running windows VM's on proxmox but in light of recent news about mainboard MFG's pushing the CPU too hard out of the box that may be the source of my stability issues as I mostly left the settings OOB for the CPU
1441,1444,2024-05-20,5,59100,the United States,14700K,This 14th generation Intel Core i7 is a powerful and fantastic processor for a desktop gaming build. The product is well packaged with some assembly instructions that are easy to follow. I heartily recommend this computer processor for DIYs and computer enthusiasts.
1442,1445,2024-05-12,5,59100,the United States,14700K,upgraded my pc from a 8700k to this bad boy. exceptional speeds and performance. temps are good and tasks are loading super fast !
1443,1446,2024-05-24,5,59100,the United States,14700K,Works as advertised.

1445,1448,2024-05-15,5,59100,the United States,14700K,this is kinda good for my GPU
1446,1449,2024-01-03,5,59100,the United States,14700K,"I guess everyone is right, these things are hot and then some. I went with a off brand AIO, and for the most part I'm good. It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.  Gaming seems fine, no issues. I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc. (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)  I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it. Just took longer and longer to render things. I guess I wore it out!  I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it. I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.  All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh! Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around."
1447,1450,2023-12-29,4,59100,the United States,14700K,"I was never a fan of Intel's business models of locking off cores/features to try and upsell the features back to the consumer.......  That aside, Intel has always been the leader in the CPU market and while AMD has been making strides in recent years Intel is still the go to for reliability and power.  Anyway.... if you have money to burn and need to upgrade due to artificial obsolesces that is the new craze of forcing people to upgrade.... well, this processor will last a long time... or until they just decide it's not capable anymore."
1448,1451,2023-12-31,5,59100,the United States,14700K,"Very good processor, upgraded form a very nice Ryzen 1700 (6 years old with me) to this one, decided to go intel due to memory stability. After 3 weeks I can say I love it, very nice temps while gaming and I've received around a 60% improvement in my games (I maintained my RTX3070). I'm currently using a NZXT Kraken Elite 360 AIO to cool it and it has been showing around 50-60 C during high intensive gaming which is very good. Went with this over the 7800X3D since I feel this is more future proof for productivity since I upgrade every 5-6 years. While I know the AM5 socket will last longer, anyways, every time I upgrade I also upgrade the motherboard. Very nice product, will recommend it."

1450,1453,2023-11-17,5,59100,the United States,14700K,Was going to wait until 15th gen to upgrade my 10900k but decided to go for it. While the 10900k is still a powerhouse this is a good upgrade and I am happy with. This processor is ridiculously fast and handles everything we would expect it to. Cyberpunk picked up 10fps with a 3080 but runs super smooth now at 4k with RT. I did pair this with a z790 Aorus and 32gb ddr5 6400.  ******** AT Own Risk******* Suggest undervolting in bios if you know what you are doing. I am running this cpu 5.7 all cores - 1.24v on a custom loop. I see idle temps 31c - gaming 60c and cinebench 89c. It will run hot if you're on air and do not adjust the default voltage. There are plenty of youtube videos out there as a resource. Overall great processor

The 12700k Cinebench score and temp was 22600/71c. The 14700k was 32000/87c . Still below throttling, which is OK according to Intel . When gaming I only see maybe five frames per second faster at 2k res .this is a good chip. Don’t get me wrong. with as many cores as this has, and the speed it should last for a long time, it far exceeds the needs of any. New or future games."
1454,1457,2023-12-05,4,59100,the United States,14700K,I had to replace my h60 to get this to run a full benchmark without hitting thermal limit of 100c with no OC. That is under full core usage during 30s intervals.  Now that I replaced the cooler with an artic cooler with some kryonaut paste I have it running 5.6 all core with dual core at 5.7 and it maxes out at 87 on furmark
1455,1458,2024-03-26,5,59100,the United States,14700K,Super easy to install. Just update your motherboard bios to support 14 Gen

I returned it and purchased elsewhere due to Amazon not having a replacement option or any available at the time for prime shipping. The one that I have now works great, so it's a good product if you get one that works.  My second gripe with this cpu is that it's basically just a refresh of 13th gen without the luxury of working out of the box with z790 mobos. You will need to flash the bios of your mobo."
1463,1466,2023-11-14,5,59100,the United States,14700K,Built a new system with the 14700k for photo/video editing and some gaming. Decided to go with the 14th gen i7 instead of the 13th gen since it's the only series that had a noticeable improvement (4 more e cores and threads). Very fast for video editing and overkill for most gaming. Absolutely love it! I keep it cool with a 360mm AIO and a contact plate for even lower temperatures.  Avg Temps:  100% Load - Low 70's  Gaming - Mid to High 40's (Low 50's for more demading titles)  Idle & Browsing - Mid 20's

1473,1476,2024-04-03,1,59100,the United States,14700K,"overall intel is great for a work station, HOWEVER the 14 series is stupid as hell... it offers NO benefit in 99.9% of situations over 13 series... I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.  On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...  If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...  There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash..."
1474,1477,2024-05-03,1,59100,the United States,14700K,I have written a couple of dozen reviews on Amazon and this is only my second negative review. I placed an order for a brand new Intel 14700K CPU from Amazon and it arrived as an Open Box (the factory seal had been cut and the processor was jammed into the packaging at an odd angle. I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing. I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.  I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund. I purchased an identical CPU from another source and that CPU booted up with no issues (it is running the PC I am typing this review on) so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that Amazon shipped to me.
1475,1478,2024-01-06,5,59100,the United States,14700K,Great cpu for gaming. No regrets
1476,1479,2024-01-21,5,59100,the United States,14700K,Just Great
1477,1480,2024-06-02,1,59100,the United States,14700K,"System booted fine with 2 ram sticks installed and it appeared that everything was fine at first but after some time issues started to show up. Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed. At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM. But testing of different RAM ruled that out. Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue. Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU. Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it. When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner."
